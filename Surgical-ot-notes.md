Procedure 1:Describe the steps of Lichtenstein hernioplasty.
 Anesthesia: Spinal anesthesia.
 Position of the patient: Supine.
Antiseptic cleaning and draping.
 Incision: inguinal incision. Starting medially at the pubic tubercle and laterally extending
beyond the deep inguinal ring 2 cm above and parallel to the inguinal ligament.
 The two layers of subcutaneous tissue (Superficial fatty layer—fascia of camper and the
deeper membranous layer—fascia of Scarpa) are incised in the same line as skin by using
diathermy. While incising the subcutaneous tissue the superficial epigastric vessels are
coagulated and cut. Medially, superficial external pudendal vessels and laterally superficial
circumflex iliac vessels may come in the field and needs coagulation and division.
 Exposure of the inguinal canal: The external oblique aponeurosis is exposed deep to the
subcutaneous tissue. A nick is made in the external oblique aponeurosis. The cut margins
are picked up in between two pairs of hemostatic forceps and external oblique aponeurosis
is incised medially dividing the superficial inguinal ring and laterally the external oblique
aponeurosis is incised beyond the deep inguinal ring.
 The upper flap of external oblique aponeurosis is dissected upwards and the conjoint
tendon is exposed. The lower flap of external oblique aponeurosis is dissected downwards
to expose the shining inguinal ligament from pubic tubercle medially to laterally beyond the
deep inguinal ring.
 Dissection of hernial sac: The spermatic cord along with the hernial sac is dissected in between
fingers using a gauze piece and lifted up from the fascia transversalis.
 in case of indirect inguinal hernia the hernial sac lies anterolateral to the cord covered by
the cremasteric muscle and the internal spermatic fascia. in case of direct inguinal hernia, the
hernial sac lies posteromedial to the cord structures covered by the internal spermatic fascia.
 The cremasteric muscle and fascia is incised and deep to this internal spermatic fascia is
incised. The cord structures are splayed inbetween fingers and the hernial sac is identified
by shiny white margin. The margin of the hernial sac is picked up by a pair of hemostatic
forceps and the hernial sac is dissected by sharp dissection from the cord structures taking
care not to damage the vas deferens and the testicular vessels.
968 Section 9 Operative Surgery
The hernial sac is dissected from the fundus to the neck of the sac. The neck of the sac is
identified by:
•	 Most constricted part of the sac
•	 There is a collar of fat pad around the neck
•	 inferior epigastric vessels are seen medial to the neck of the sac
 opening of hernial sac and reduction of contents: The hernial sac is opened at the fundus
and the interior of the sac is inspected to exclude a sliding component.
(in case of complete inguinal hernia when the fundus of the hernial sac lies at the bottom of the
scrotum, the whole sac need not be dissected. The sac is dissected from the cord structures in
the inguinal canal and transected at the middle and the distal part of the sac is left as such. The
proximal part of the sac is then dissected up to the neck of the sac). The contents of the hernia
are reduced into the peritoneal cavity.
Herniotomy: The hernial sac is twisted and the neck of the sac is transfixed and the distal
sac is excised.
Reinforcement of the posterior wall by placement of a polypropylene mesh: A standard 15 cm
× 7.5 cm sized mesh is required for inguinal hernia. The lateral end of the mesh is split at the
lower 1/3rd and upper 2/3rd junction to accommodate the spermatic cord. The lower margin
of the mesh is fixed to the inguinal ligament starting medially at the fascia over the pubic
tubercle extending laterally along the inguinal ligament beyond the deep inguinal ring using
2-0 polypropylene suture.The mesh is medially sutured to the lateral border of the rectus
sheath. The mesh is fixed above to the conjoint tendon using 2-0 polypropylene sutures.The
split lateral end of the mesh is resutured beyond the spermatic cord.
Closure of external oblique aponeurosis: The external oblique aponeurosis is sutured using
runing 1-0 polyproylene suture creating a new superficial inguinal ring.
Closure of sucutaneous tissue and skin: The skin and subcutaneous tissue is apposed using
interrupted sutures with monofilament polyamide. Alternatively the skin and subcutaneous
tissue my be apposed using subcuticular sutures with 3-0 polyglactin.


procedure 2:Describe the steps of herniotomy for congenital hernia?
 Simple herniotomy is required
 Anesthesia: operation is usually done under general anesthesia.
 Skin Incision: A transverse skin incision is made over the groin overlying the deep inguinal
ring parallel to the inguinal ligament.The skin and superficial fascia are incised (Fig. 22.1A).
 Incising the external oblique aponeurosis: The external oblique aponeurosis is incised in the
same line (Figs 22.1B and c).
 Dissection of hernial sac: The cord with its covering and the hernial sac is isolated and
dissected free from the fascia transversalis. The coverings of the cord—external spermatic
fascia, the cremaster a and internal spermatic fascia are gently teased open just distal
to superficial inguinal ring to dissect the hernial sac. The sac is dissected from cord
structures (Figs 22.1D and e)
 Opening of sac and reduction of the contents of sac: The sac is opened and contents of the sac
is milked into the peritoneal cavity.
 Transection of the sac: The sac is transected distal to the superficial inguinal ring and the
distal part of the sac is left open as such ensuring that there is no bleeding from the distal
stump of the sac.
 Ligation of the neck of the sac: The proximal stump of the sac is held up by a hemostatic forcep
and dissected proximally up to the internal inguinal ring. By rotating the clamp, the sac is
twisted and ligated by transfixation at the neck and the redundant sac excised (Fig. 22.1F).
 Closure: The cord structures are covered by closing the covering of the sac.
the external oblique aponeurosis closed with absorbable suture and skin apposed by
subcuticular suture (Fig. 22.1F).
What is the difference in technique in older children?
in child more than 2 years of age, the external and internal ring become widely separated so
that direct dissection is no longer possible.
in these cases, skin incision is made slightly laterally over the internal inguinal ring. The skin
and superficial fascia is incised. The external oblique aponeurosis is incised and inguinal canal
exposed—the external ring is not opened.
The cremesteric fascia and internal spermatic fascia is incised and sac dissected free from
the cord structures. The sac is clamped across and the distal part of the sac transected and kept
open. The proximal part of the sac is dissected up to the deep ring and tackled as described above.



procedure 3:Describe the steps of TAPP operation (Fig. 22.2).
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of the patient: Initially supine. After creation of pneumoperitoneum patient turned
to Trendelenburg position with slight elevation of the side to be operated. Monitor kept at the
leg end towards the side of hernia. Surgeon stands on the contralateral side. Assistant stands

970 Section 9 Operative Surgery
opposite to the surgeon. Bilateral hernia can be operated from either side.Patient’s hand kept
by the side of trunk and patient well strapped to the table.
Pateint should be catheterized.
 Creation of pneumoperitoneum: A 10 mm subumbilical incision is made. And a Veress needle
inserted into the peritoneal cavity. After confirming the position of the Veress needle in the
figure 22.2: Transabdominal preperitoneal laparoscopic hernia repair (TAPP)
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 971
peritoneal cavity the Veress needle is connected to the automatic electronic insufflator set to
12 mm Hg intra-abdominal pressure and intial flow rate to 1 liter/min. Pneumoperitoneum
achieved with insufflation of carbon dioxide.
 Placement of subumbilical ports: A 10 mm subumbilical port is inserted with gentle rocking
movement taking care not to injure the intrabdominal organ or vessels.
 Placement of subsequent ports: Two more 5 mm port is inserted in right and left lower quadrant
of the abdomen slightly below the umbilicus lateral to the rectus abdominis taking care not to
injure the inferior epigastric vessels.
•	 Inspection of pelvic anatomy: Inspect the bladder, median umbilical fold (containing the
obliterated urachus), medial umbilical fold (containing the obliterated umbilical artery),
lateral umbilical fold (containing the inferior epigastric artery).
 The indirect hernial sac descends through the deep inguinal ring which is lateral to the
lateral umbilcal fold.The direct hernial sac descends through the Hesselbach’s triangle, which
lies medial to the lateral umbilical fold. The triangle of Doom is the area bounded.
− Laterally by the testicular vessels
− Medially by the vas deferens
− Above by the line joining the vas deferens and the testicular vessels.
The external iliac vessels lie in this triangle.
 Division of peritoneum: The hernial contents are reduced. The peritoneum is picked up by a
grasper about 2 cm medial to the anterior superior iliac spine about 3–4 cm above the inguinal
ligament. The peritoneum is incised at this level by an endoscissor. This incision is then carried
medially above the hernial defect up to the medial umbilical fold.
 Downward reflection of peritoneum and dissection of preperitoneal space: The incised
peritoneum is reflected downwards by sharp and blunt dissection and the preperitoneal space
is delineated. Medially the dissection is done up to the symphysis pubis. Below the dissection is
done up to the obturator foramen. Laterally the dissection is done up to the iliopsoas muscle.
Following the Cooper’s ligament the deep,inguinal ring is identified.
 Dissection of hernial sac: In case of direct hernia, the hernial sac is dissected while lifting the
peritoneal flap. In case of indirect inguinal hernia the hernial sac lies anterior to the cord
structure. Using two grasping forceps the hernial sac is dissected off from the cord structures
taking care not to injure the cord structures. The hernial sac is dissected up to the fundus distally
and the proximal limit of dissection is up to the point where the vas deferens and the testicular
vessels diverges. If the hernial sac is complete, the hernial sac is transected at the middle and
the distal sac kept laid open.
 Placement and fixation of mesh in preperitoneal space: A polypropylene mesh size of 12
cm × 15 cm is ideal for inguinal hernia. The mesh is rolled and a suture is placed in the
middle of the rolled mesh which helps in better placement and unrolling. The rolled mesh
is inserted into the peritoneal cavity through the 10 mm trocar. The mesh is placed in the
preperitoneal space. Medially the mesh is placed up to the symphysis pubis and laterally 2
cm medial to the anterior superior iliac spine. Below the mesh is placed along the Cooper’s
ligament and lateral to the deep ring along the inguinal ligament. The mesh is unrolled
and spread to cover the deep inguinal ring and the Hesselbach’s triangle. The mesh is fixed
by tacker to the Cooper’s ligament medially, above to the anterior abdominal wall. Care
is taken not to place any tacker over the triangle Doom and the triangle of pain (lateral to
the testicular vessels).
972 Section 9 Operative Surgery
 Repositioning of peritoneal flap and closure of peritoneal defect: The peritoneal edge is grasped
and returned to its normal postion. The peritoneal defect is apposed by intracorporeal suturing
or by using tackers to avoid contact of mesh with the intra-abdominal viscera.
 Closure of port sites: 10 mm port site—linea alba apposed by 1-0 polyglactin sutures.
Skin apposed with monofilament polyamide sutures.


procedure 4:Describe the steps of TEP operation for inguinal hernia.
 Anesthesia—General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of patient: Same as TAPP operation.
 Placement of Subumbilical port: An infraumbilical 1.5 cm incision is made. The subcutaneous
tissue is dissected and the anterior rectus sheath is exposed. The anterior rectus sheath is incised
horizontally. The rectus muscle is dissected from the linea alba and retracted laterally.
 Creation of preperitoneal space: A balloon trocar is inserted into the space between the rectus
abdominis muscle anteriorly and the posterior rectus sheath posteriorly. The ballon is inflated
by air and the preperitoneal space is created.
 Insertion of 11 mm trocar: The balloon trocar is removed and a 11 mm trocar is introduced
into the preperitoneal space thus created and CO2
 gas is insufflated through the cannula and
the preperitoneal space is created further.
 Insertion of telescope: A 10 mm telescope attached to the light source and camera is introduced
through the subumbilical trocar. Further creation of the preperitoneal space may be achieved
by blunt dissection using the telescope.
 Placement of subsequent ports: Placement of 2 more 5 mm ports is required. One 5 mm port
is inserted in the midline under direct vision about 1 cm above the symphysis pubis. Another
5 mm port is inserted in the midline midway between the suprapubic and subumbilical trocar.
Patient is placed in the Trendelenburgh position with the side of the hernia being tilted up.
 Dissection of the hernial sac: The Cooper’s ligament is identified lateral to the symphysis pubis
and cleared of any preperitoneal fat.
If direct hernia is present, the sac will be readily identified during this dissection and reduced.
Dissection of indirect hernial sac: The lateral dissection is done by using a Maryland grasper.
The indirect hernial sac lies lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels and anterolateral to the cord
structures. The hernial sac is dissected off from the cord structures taking care not to injure the
testicular vessels and the vas deferens.
 Parietalisation of the cord structures: For ease of placement of the mesh, the cord structures
are dissected from the preperitoneal loose areolar tissue till the point of divergence of the vas
deferens and the testicular vessels.
During dissection of the preperitoneal space, if the peritoneum is opened inadvertently there
will be loss of preperitoneal space due to creation of pneumoperitoneum.
In this situation the option will be to:
•	 Close the peritoneal rent
•	 Insert a Veress needle into the peritoneal cavity for deflation or
•	 Convert this to a TAPP procedure.
Placement and fixation of the mesh—same as TAPP procedure.
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 973
Desufflation of the peritoneal space by a slow and controlled manner and the trocars are
removed.
 Closure at 11 mm port site anterior rectus sheath apposed by 2-0 vicryl suture and skin with
monofilament polyamide suture.




procedure 05:Describe the steps of D2 gastrectomy for gastric cancer.
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of the patient: Supine.
 Antiseptic dressing and draping.
 Incision: Midline incision starting below the xiphisternal junction to halfway between the
umbilicus and the symphysis pubis. The skin and subcutaneous tissue are incised in the
same line.
 Division of linea alba: The linea alba is incised in the same line.
 Division of surgical peritoneum: The fascia transversalis, extraperitoneal fatty tissue and the
parietal peritoneum are lifted up in between two pairs of hemostatic forceps and a nick is
made in the peritoneum and the opening in the peritoneum is then extended in the same
line.
 Assess for distant spread liver metastasis, peritoneal deposits, omental deposits, pelvic
deposits and presence of ascites. in presence of distant metastasis, curative resection is not
attempted. if resectable, resection of the primary growth offers best palliation.
 Assessment of lymph node status: Assess the site of involvement and number of lymph nodes
involved whether mobile or fixed. Gross lymph node involvement also precludes a curative
resection.
 Exploratory laparotomy: Assess the local growth, the location, size and depth of invasion,
involvement of adjacent structures. Gross invasion to adjacent structures precludes a curative
resection. involvement of transverse mesocolon and tail of pancreas may be managed with
resection of a segment of colon and tail of pancreas.
 Division of greater omentum and anterior layer of transverse mesocolon: The procedure begins
with division of greater omentum from the transverse colon by sharp dissection through a
bloodless plane. Some small blood vessels may be controlled with diathermy.
 The greater omentum is cleared from the whole of transverse colon. The anterior layer of
transverse mesocolon is incised and stripped up up to the anterior surface of the pancreas.

chapter 22 Operative Surgery 977
 Division of right gastroepiploic vessels: As the greater curvature is lifted up along with the
greater omentum the right gastroepiploic vessels are seen entering the pyloric end of greater
curvature. The right gastroepiploic vessels are divided in between ligatures.
 Division of lesser omentum (gastrohepatic ligament): The gastrohepatic omentum is dissected
and divided close to the porta hepatis and the right gastric artery is ligated and divided close
to its origin from the hepatic artery. The omentum to the right of ascending part (lst part) of
the duodenum is divided and the duodenum is kocherised.
 Division of duodenum: once the right gastric artery and right gastroepiploic arteries are
tied the first part of the duodenum is dissected all around. two pairs of soft clamps are then
applied and the stomach divided just beyond the pylorus.
The subpyloric and the suprapyloric lymph nodes are also included with the specimen.
 Closure of duodenal stump: The duodenal stump is closed in 2 layers—1st layer with through
and through continuous 3-0 polyglactin sutures and a second layer of inverting suture with
3-0 mersilk.
 Alternatively the duodenum may be divided with a linear cutter which cuts the duodenum
and staples both the cut ends.
The duodenal stump may also be closed with a linear stapler.
 Dissection of lymph nodes: The divided stomach is lifted up and the lymph nodes in the gastric
bed are dissected. The lymph nodes along the hepatic artery are dissected up to their origin.
The lymph nodes along the splenic artery are dissected up to the hilum of spleen. The left
gastric artery is divided at its origin from the celiac trunk and the lymph nodes around the
left gastric artery are resected en bloc.
 Resection of the stomach: two pairs of gastric occlusion clamps are applied obliquely.
 on the lesser curvature side the line of resection is just below the cardia. on the greater
curvature side the line of resection is just below the last short gastric vessels. it should be
at least 5 cm proximal to the proximal margin of the tumor. The stomach is then transected
between the two pairs of occlusion clamps.
Alternatively, the stomach may be divided by using GiA linear cutter.
 Gastrojejunal anastomosis: The proximal loop of the jejunum is brought up through a rent in
the transverse mesocolon and placed alongside the transected stomach. Afferent loop may
be brought to the lesser curvature and efferent loop to the greater curvature side. two pairs of
Babcock’s tissue forceps are applied to the jejunal loop and a light intestinal occlusion clamp
is applied to the jejunum and holding the two clamps together, the stomach and jejunum
are kept side by side.
 Alternatively a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal anastomosis may be done.
A continuous seromuscular suture is applied between the stomach and the jejunum with
3-0 mersilk.
 to create a valvular anastomosis the upper part of the cut end of the stomach is closed with
through and through sutures using 3-0 polyglactin sutures leaving 5 cm area open. The jejunum
is incised for 5 cm and is anastomosed with the remaining cut end of the stomach. The posterior
through and through and anterior through sutures are applied with continuous 3-0 polyglactin
suture. The anterior seromuscular layer is applied with continuous 3-0 mersilk suture.
 Fixation of stomach to the mesocolon rent: The anastomosis is brought down through the
rent in the mesocolon. The margins of the rent is sutured to the stomach wall by interrupted
stitches.
 Drainage: A 26 Fr. tube abdominal drain is kept in hepatorenal pouch of Morrison close to
the duodenal stump.
 Closure: Pertioneum and linea alba closed in single layer with continuous no. l polypropylene
suture.
Skin closed with interrupted monofilament polyamide suture.



procedure 06:Describe the steps of truncal vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy.
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of the patient—supine.
Antiseptic cleaning and draping.
 Incision: A upper midline incision extending from xiphoid to the umbilicus. the skin
subcutaneous tissue, linea alba and the surgical peritoneum incised in the same line.
 Exploration of abdomen: A thorough exploration of abdomen to identify any associated
disease. The site of the ulcer is palpated.
 Exposure of the abdominal part of the esophagus: A self-retaining retractor is placed to retract
the abdominal wall on either side. The left triangular ligament of liver is incised and the left
lobe of liver is retracted towards the right to expose the abdominal part of the esophagus.The
peritoneum reflecting from the esophagus is incised transversely for about 3–4 cm on either side
 Division of the anterior vagus nerve: The stomach is held by the assistant pulling it downards
and outwards. the anterior vagus now stands out infront of the abdominal part of the
esophagus and gastroesophageal junction is well seen. The anterior vagus nerve is dissected
with a right angled forceps. The nerve trunk is held by two pairs of hemostatic forceps both
above and below and the intervening 1 cm of the nerve trunk is excised. The proximal and
distal cut ends are ligated with silk sutures.
 Division of posterior vagus nerve trunk: The gastrohepatic omentum is divided close to the
cardioesophageal junction and lesser sac is entered. The stomach is held by the assistant
upwards and outwards and the posterior vagal nerve trunk is identified by finger dissection
in the groove between posterior wall of esophagus and the aorta. The thick nerve trunk is
dissected using a right angled forceps, held by two pairs of haemostatic forceps at upper
and lower dissected end and the intervening 1 cm of segment is excised. The cut ends are
ligated with black silk.
 Drainage procedure: truncal vagotomy should be combined with a drainage procedure. This
may be achieved either with pyloroplasty or gastrojejunostomy.
 Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal anastomosis: earlier a loop gastrojejunostomy was usual practice.
But a now a days a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal anastomosis is preferred.
 Fashioning of a Roux loop of jejunum: the Roux loop is fashioned about 15 cm from
duodenojejunal flexure. The jejunal loop is held up by the assistant and the mesentery is
illuminated. The vessels in the mesentery are well seen. At the point of proposed jejunal
transection, the mesentery is divided after the mesenteric vessels are dissected, ligated and
divided taking care to maintain adequate blood supply to both the proximal and distal limb
of the loop after division. The jejunum is transected at the point of division of the mesentery.
The distal loop may be lengthened by dividing the intermediate branches joining the arcade,
taking care to maintain the blood supply via the adjacent arcade.
 Closure of the end of distal jejunal limb: The end of the distal jejunal limb is closed in 2 layers
using inner through and through (all coat) layers using 3-0 polyglactin sutures and outer
seromuscular layer using same suture.
http://vip.persianss.ir/
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 979
 Gastrojejunal anastomosis: A posterior gastrojejunostomy is preferred. An incision is made in
the transverse mesocolon to the right of middle colic vessels (space of Riolan). The posterior
wall of the stomach is held up by two pairs of Babcock’s tissue forceps and delivered through
the rent in the transverse mesocolon. A pair of gastric occlusion clamp is applied keeping
an adequate length of the stomach beyond the clamp. the distal limb of the Roux en Y
loop is brought close to the stomach keeping the closed end towards the left. An intestinal
occlusion clamp is applied to the jejunum and the stomach and jejunum kept side by side.
The anastomosis is done in following layers:
 A continuous posterior seromuscular suture appposing the stomach to the jejunum with
3-0 polydioxanone suture (PDS suture).
 About 5 cm gastrotomy and jejunotomy is made using diathermy knife parallel to the
seromuscular suture applied.
 The next layer is posterior through and through taking all layers of stomach and jejunum
using 3-0 polyglactin suture.
 once posterior through and through layer is completed the same suture is continued as
continuous anterior through and through layer taking all coats of the stomach and jejunum.
The occlusion clamps are removed and check for any bleeding.
 The anastomosis is completed by applying continuous anterior seromuscular layer using
3-0 polydioxanone suture.
 Closure of the mesocolon rent: The stomach wall is anchored to the mesocolon rent by
applying few interrupted 3-0 mersilk suture to prevent internal herniation through the
mesocolon rent.
 Jejunojejunal anastomosis: the jejunal continuity is maintained by jejunojejunal
anastomosis about 35 cm distal to the gastrojejunal anastomosis. The proximal jejunum
is kept by the side of distal jejunum at the site of proposed anastomosis. A jejunotomy
is made at the antimesenteric border of the distal jejunum matching the lumen of the
proximal jejunal limb.The anastomosis is done by single layer interrupted all coat stitches
using 3-0 PDS suture.
 Approximation of the cut margin of jejunal mesentery: The cut margin of the proximal jejunal
mesentery is apposed to the distal jejunal mesentery by interrupted 3-0 mersilk suture to
prevent internal herniation. care should be taken so that jejunal vessels are not punctured
while taking these stitches.
 Closure: The surgical peritoneum and the linea alba is closed in single layer by a contiunuous
suture using no. 1 loop PDS suture. Skin is apposed by interrupted 2-0 monofilament
polyamide suture.



procedure 07:Describe the steps of repair of peptic perforation.
 General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation.
 Position of patient—supine.
 Antiseptic dressing and draping.
 Abdomen opened by an upper midline incision. Skin and subcutaneous tissues are incised.
The linea alba is incised in the same line. The surgical peritoneum is lifted up in-between
two pairs of hemostatic forceps and incised in-between the pairs of hemostatic forceps. The
http://vip.persianss.ir/
980 Section 9 Operative Surgery
peritoneum incision is then extended up and down. As soon as the peritoneum is incised,
gas and bile stained peritoneal fluid escape.
 The peritoneal fluid is aspirated and the site of perforation is localized. The liver is retracted
by a Deaver’s retractor and the stomach is drawn downward by the assistant using a moist
sponge (Fig. 22.3A). The distal stomach and the duodenum is inspected.
 Simple closure of the perforation is the preferred surgical treatment.
 Three or four interrupted polyglactin (vicryl) or polyglycollic acid (Dexon) sutures are inserted
along the axis of the gut. The central stitch traverses through the center of the perforation
(Fig. 22.3B).
 The corner sutures are tied first and the central stitch is tied last. The suture line may be
reinforced by placing a tag of omentum over the site of perforation and the sutures are tied
over the omentum (Fig. 22.3c).
figures 22.3a to c: Repair of peptic perforation
 After closure of the perforation the meticulous peritoneal toilet is done. The subphrenic paces,
paracolic gutters and the pelvis are cleared of all turbid fluid and these areas are irrigated
with normal saline and the lavage fluid aspirated back.
 A drain is placed in the hepatorenal pouch of Morrison and abdomen is closed. However,
the use of drain is not always essential.
 The peritoneum and the linea alba is closed with a continuous no. 1 polypropylene sutures.
The skin is closed by interrupted sutures using monofilament polyamide sutures.

•	 inj. Metronidazole 500 mg iV thrice daily.
 intravenous Ranitidine or omeprazole.
 Monitoring of pulse, blood pressure, respiration, temperature and urine output.
 once bowel sounds return and the patient passes flatus, oral fluid is started and by 3–5 days
patient is given semisolid diet.



procedure 08:Describe the steps of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Sac and the spermatic cord
Repositioning of testis into the scrotum: The testis with the everted hydrocele sac is reinserted
into the scrotal sac taking care so that there is no rotation of the testis. This is ascertained by
keeping the head of the epididymis superiorly and sinus of the epididymis laterally.
Check for hemostasis: if there is oozing, a corrugated rubber sheet drain may be placed into
the scrotum.
Closure: The internal spermatic fascia, cremesteric fascia , external spermatic fascia and the
Dartos muscle are apposed by a continuous 2-0 chromic catgut sutures. Skin is apposed by
interrupted monofilament polyamide suture. A coconut bandage is applied.
 Anesthesia: The operation is done under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Antiseptic cleaning and draping: From midchest to midthigh.
 Position of the Patient: initially patient is supine. The position is changed after induction of
pneumoperitoneum. Patient is placed in reverse trendelenburg position with right side up
position.
1. Establishment of pneumoperitoneum: intra-abdominal pressure is preset to 12 mm Hg
to 14 mm Hg in automatic insufflator. An 1 cm size smiling incision is made below the
umbilicus. A Veress needle is inserted into the abdomen at right angle taking care not to
injure the underlying abdominal organs or big vessel. The position of the needle inside
the peritoneal cavity is confirmed by injecting about 5 mL of saline and reaspirating it. if
the needle is in correct place the saline could be pushed easily and on aspiration nothing
will come. This can also be confirmed by drop test. A drop of saline is placed at the back of
needle and abdominal wall is lifted up. The needle is in correct place, the saline drop will
be sucked in. once the needle is confirmed to be in the peritoneal cavity, it is connected
to an automatic carbon dioxide insufflator by the insufflation tube. The carbon dioxide
flow is started at slow rate (1–2 liter/min). Afterwards the flow rate is increased. once the
abdomen is inflated to a sufficient level the Veress needle is withdrawn.
 2. First Trocar Entry: The first trocar is placed blindly and there is risk of injury to the underly
in viscera or vessels. A 10 mm trocar and cannula is inserted into the abdomen below
the umbilicus and trocar is removed keeping the cannula in place.
 3. Introduction of the telescope attached to a video camera: The video camera light case
attached to 30 degree, 10 mm telescope is inserted into the peritoneal cavity through
the infraumbilical trocar.
 4. Inspection of the peritoneal cavity: The picture of the abdominal cavity is now displayed
in the video screen.
 The pelvis is inspected first and then attention is drawn towards the gallbladder.
 5. Introduction of 2nd,3rd and 4th port (Fig. 22.4A): The next three ports are made under
direct vision.
 The second 10 mm port is made at the epigastrium below the xiphoid just to the right
of midline so that the trocar goes into the abdomen to the right of falciform ligament.
 one 5 mm port is made in the right midclavicular line just below the right costal margin
and a second 5 mm port is made in the right anterior axillary line at the level of the
umbilicus.

 6. Dissection of cystic pedicle and the Calot’s triangle (Fig. 22.4B): The patient is positioned
reversed trendelenburg’s position with the right side up to allow the intestine to fall
away from the right hypochondriac region. With the Maryland dissector the anterior leaf
and the posterior leaf of the cystic pedicle is teased off and the cystic duct and artery is
dissected clearly. Posterior dissection of the calot’s triangle is the most important initial
step. Anterior dissection of the calot’s triangle is complementary and should be done
after the posterior dissection is done. A large window is created between the cystic duct
and the artery so that the clips may be applied easily.
 7. Application of clips and division of cystic duct and artery (Fig. 22.4c): once the cystic
duct and artery is cleared off they are clipped with titanium clips applied by a 10 mm.
clip applier inserted through the epigastric port. Three clips are applied in the cystic
duct and three in the cystic artery and the duct and artery is divided by an endoscissors
keeping two clips in the cystic duct and artery towards the bile duct side.

8. Dissection of the gallbladder from gallbladder bed of liver (Figs 22.4D and e): once the
cystic duct and the artery is divided the gallbladder is now dissected by using a unipolar
diathermy hook from the liver bed.
9. Irrigation and suction: once the gallbladder is free, the gallbladder bed is irrigated
with normal saline and check for any bleeding which may be controlled by diathermy
coagulation.
10. Extraction of gallbladder: The separated gallbladder is then held up by a crocodile forceps
and removed through the epigastric port.
11. Placement of drain: Placement of a drain is optional. if there is slight oozing or if the
surgery is difficult then a tube drain may be placed in the hepatorenal pouch of Morrison
for 24–48 hours.
 12. Closure of the incision: The cannulas are withdrawn and the incisions are closed. The
sheath in the 10 mm port areas are closed with vicryl sutures.


procedure 09:Steps of open cholecystectomy:
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of the patient: Supine. if intraoperative cholangiogram is required then patient should
be placed on a special operation table with transparent top. There should be provision for
insertion of a Buckey grid for placement of an X-ray plate for exposure.
 Antiseptic cleaning and draping: Antiseptic cleaning by application of povidone iodine
solution from midchest to midthigh.
 Incision: Right subcostal incision (Kocher’s incision).
 The structures incised in Kocher's subcostal incision:
 Preliminary exploration: The stomach, duodenum, colon, pancreas and liver are examined
first. The gallbladder is examined, look for color, any adhesions, palpated for any calculi.
The supraduodenal part of the common bile duct is palpated at the free margin of the lesser
omentum with index finger in the epiploic foramen and thumb in front to exclude presence of
any calculi. The retroduodenal part of the common bile duct is palpated by keeping the finger
tips along the lateral border of the second part of the duodenum and by placing the thumb
anteriorly in the groove between the duodenum and the pancreas.
 Placement of mops: The next step is good exposure. Three mops are placed. The first mop
is placed in the hepatorenal pouch to retract the right colic fiexure downward. The second
mop is placed in the lower part of the wound to retract the duodenum, transverse colon and
the small intestine. The third mop is placed more medially to retract the stomach.
 Retraction and exposure: Deep retractors are placed and held by the assistants for good
exposure. one Deaver’s retractor retracts the right lobe of the liver upward and another
Deaver’s retractor retracts the lower part of the wound.
 Dissection of the cystic pedicle: the fundus of the gallbladder is held by a Moynihan’s
cholecystectomy forceps. Another Moynihan’s cholecystectomy forceps is applied at the
Hartmann’s pouch and the gallbladder is retracted downward and to the right. The anterior
layer of the peritoneum covering the cystic duct and artery is snipped off with a scissors and
the cystic duct and artery dissected by blunt dissection using a peanut swab. The cystic artery
often runs anterior to the cystic duct.
 Ligation of cystic artery and duct: The cystic artery is dissected by using a right angle forceps
and two ligatures of no. 1-0 silk suture is passed around the cystic artery. These are then tied
and the cystic artery is divided inbetween the ligatures. Similarly the cystic duct is dissected
by using the right angle forceps and two ligatures are passed around the cystic duct. These
ligatures are tied and the cystic duct divided inbetween the ligatures. For safety one additional
ligature may be applied in the cystic artery and the duct.
 Dissection of gallbladder from liver: The gallbladder is retracted by using the Moynihan’s
cholecystectomy forceps and a finger is insinuated between the gallbladder and the liver and
the gallbladder is gently dissected from its bed. As the gallbladder is lifted from its bed, fine
fringes stand out. These are divided with diathermy or ligated and divided, as fine vessels are
present in these strands. As the gallbladder is dissected, the peritoneal reflection from the
gallbladder to the liver is divided with scissors or diathermy knife. A fringe of peritoneum is
kept on either side of the gallbladder bed. While lifting the gallbladder from gallbladder bed
in liver, look for any cholecystohepatic duct.
 Hemostasis: The gallbladder bed is checked for bleeding. Bleeding points are either ligated
or coagulated with diathermy. A hot moist pack may also control minor bleeding in the
gallbladder bed. The margins of the raw area of the gallbladder bed may be apposed with
interrupted or continuous sutures of chromic catgut.
 Drainage: A drainage tube is kept in the subhepatic space.
 Closure: closure is done in layers (see abdominal incisions).




procedure 10:Describe the steps of choledocholithotomy (Fig. 22.5).
if operated for gallstones and common bile duct stones—Kocher’s subcostal or right paramedian
or midline incisions.
A laparotomy is done and presenceof gallbladder and common bile duct stone confirmed by
palpation. The gallbladder is held by Moyhnihan’s cholecystectomy forceps and the peritoneum
of the cystic pedicle is dissected and the cystic duct and artery is dissected. cystic artery ligated
and divided. A suture is passed around the cystic duct for ease of lateral retraction.
Identifying the bile duct: The bile duct is dissected by lifting and incising the peritoneum from
its anterior aspect. Bile duct identified by aspirating bile.
Application of stay sutures: two stay sutures are applied on either side of the supraduodenal
part of the bile duct using 3-0 atraumatic chromic catgut suture.
Making a choledochotomy: choledochotomy is done in supraduodenal part of common bile
duct in between the stay sutures and the incision extended for about 2 cm.
Removal of CBD stones: A Desjardin’s choledocholithotomy forceps is introduced into the bile
duct and the stones removed. This may be aided by introduction of a choledochoscope through
the choledochotomy and stone may be extracted by a Dormia basket catheter introduced through
the choledochoscope.
The bile duct is then irrigated with normal saline to flush off the small fragments of stone
or debris.
An intraoperative cholangiogram is done to ascertain complete clearance of the bile duct
stones.
Introduction of tube: A t tube is fashioned for placement in the bile duct. The horizontal limb
is deroofed and proximal end kept for about 2–5 cm and distal end kept for about 4 cm. The
choloedochotomy is closed keeping a t tube in the bile duct.
Alternatively a choledocho duodenostomy may be done.




procedure 11:Describe the steps of choledochoduodenostomy.
This is usually done following choledocholithotomy.
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of patient supine
 Antiseptic cleaning and draping.
 Incision: Approach is as in open cholecystectomy, through Kocher’s subcostal incision.
 Cholecystectomy: Mops are placed to expose the area of Calot’s triangle.
 Gallbladder is held by Moynihan’s cholcystectomy forceps at the fundus and the Hartman’s
pouch and the cystic pedicle is dissected, ligated and divided.
 Choledocholithotomy: The cystic duct stump is retracted to reach the bile duct.
 The peritoneum in front of the bile duct is incised and the bile duct is exposed. Bile duct is
confirmed by aspiration of bile.
 Two stay sutures are applied on either side of the midline in the anterior wall of bile duct using
3-0 chromic catgut suture.
 A choledochotomy is done.. and the stones are removed from the bile duct using Desjardin’s
choledocholithotomy forceps. The bile duct is irrigated with saline to clear off the any residual
stone or debris.
figure 22.5: Choledocholithotomy
 Choledochoduodenostomy:
 Mobilisation of the 1st part of duodenum: The first part of the duodenum is mobilized by
dividing the hepatoduodenal ligament. The right gastric artery is ligated and divided. This
allows 1st part of the duodenum to be brought up for choledochoduodenostomy without
tension.
 Incision on duodenum: Choledochotomy is already made for removal of bile duct stones.A
similar incision is made in the anterior wall of duodenum along its axis.
 Anastomosis: Anastomosis is done with interrupted suture using 4-0 polyglactin or
polydioxanone.
 Take bite from the angle of the duodenotomy to the middle of the choledochotomy on either
side. Interrupted suture at 3 mm interval is taken between the duodenum and the bile duct
forming the posterior wall. All the sutures in the posterior wall are then tied.
 The anterior layer of sutures are then taken between the duodenum and the bile duct and tied
at the end.
 Closure: Check for hemostasis. A drain is kept in the hepatorenal pouch of Morrison.
 Incision is closed in layers.

procedure 12:Describe the steps of Whipple’s pancreaticoduodenectomy.
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of the patient: Supine.
Antiseptic cleaning and draping
 Incision: A long midline incision extending from xiphoid to well below the umbilicus. The
subcutaneous tissue is incised in the same line. The linea alba and the surgical peritoneum is
incised in the same line and the peritoneal cavity entered. (In obsese patient with wide costal,
margin a roof top incision provides better exposure).
 Exploration of abdomen: Assess for distant metastasis—presence of ascites, liver,omentum and
pelvis is examined for presence of any nodules. Presence of distant metastasis is a contraindication
for resection. Mobile lymph nodes within the area of resection is not a contraindication for resection.
However, presence of fixed nodes is a contraindication for resection.
 Assessment for resectability: This involves a number of steps to decide about the resectability.
 Exposure of the duodenum and the head of the pancreas: The peritoneum lateral to the right
colic flexure is incised and the colic flexure is dissected down to expose the duodenum and the
head of the pancreas. While doing so the right gastroepiploic vein draining into the superior
mesenteric vein needs ligature and division.
Kocherisation of duodenum: The peritoneal attachment at the lateral border of 2nd part of
duodenum is incised and the duodenum kocherized lifting it up from the inferior vena cava,
aorta and the retroperitoneum. Any infiltration of the tumor into the inferior vena cava or aorta
is a contraindication for resection. The first part of the duodenum is also mobilized by incising
the peritoneum from the superior border of the duodenum up to the foramen of Winslow.
Exposure of the pancreas: The greater omentum is divided in between ligature and the head,
neck and body of the pancreas is exposed well.Small vessels infront of the head pancreas needs
ligature and division for proper exposure of the head of the pancreas.
Exposure and dissection of superior mesenteric vessels: The Kocher’s maneuver is extended to
the third part of the duodenum. The third part of the duodenum is mobilized and the superior
mesenteric vessels are identified crossing the 3rd part of the duodenum, SMA to the left and SMV
988 Section 9 Operative Surgery
to the right. Small vessels joining the middle colic vein, SMV from the pancreaticoduodenal
vein needs ligature and division. An attempt is made to create a tunnel between the superior
mesenteric vein and the neck of the pancreas. A judgement is made at this stage regarding
tumor invasion into the SMV or portal vein. Any invasion indicates inoperability.
However, now a days if expertise is availbale, it is possible to resect a segment of portal vein
with the tumor followed by reconstruction with a prosthetic graft.
 Dissection of hepatoduodenal ligament and portal structures: The heaptoduodenal ligament
is divided close to the liver and the peritonuem and the loose areolar tissue over the bile duct,
hepatic artery and the portal vein are dissected alongwith the pericholedochal lymph nodes.
The bile duct is dissected all around. The gastroduodenal artery arising from the hepatic artery
is dissected, ligated and divided. This gives a good exposure of the portal vein. An attempt is
now made to complete the tunnel between the neck of the pancreas and the portal vein. If there
is no invasion into the portal vein the resection can proceed.
 Cholecystectomy and division of bile duct: The cystic artery is dissected and ligated. The
gallbladder is dissected off from the liver bed starting with the fundus and dissected up to the
bile duct. The already dissected bile duct is divided above the cystic duct insertion.
 Division of gastrohepatic omentum and lymph nodes: The lesser omentum is incised close
to,the liver and the peritoneum over the common hepatic artery is incised. The lymph nodes
around the CHA is dissected and swept down towards the specimen. The lymph nodes around
the common bile duct and the portal vein are also swept down towards the specimen.
 Distal gastrectomy: While dissecting the hepatic artery, the right gastric artery is dissected,
ligated and divided close to the pylorus. The distal third of the stomach needs resection in
Whipple’s operation. The right gastroepiploic artery is dissected, ligated and divided near
the lower border of the pylorus. The left gastric arcade along the lesser curvature is dissected,
ligated and divided at the site of proposed gastric resection. The left gastroepiploic arcade is also
dissected, ligated and divided at the greater curvature at the site of proposed gastric resection.
Two pairs of intestinal occlusion clamps are applied and the stomach divided inbetween.
 Division of the neck of the pancreas: Two pairs of stay sutures are applied along the upper and
lower border of the junction of body and neck of the pancreas to minimize bleeding. A soft clamp
may be applied to the specimen side and the neck of the pancreas is transected using cutting
diathermy. While doing so the portal vein lying behind the neck of the pancreas is safeguarded
by placing a dissector inbetween the neck of the pancreas and the portal vein.
 Division of the jejunum: The duodenojejunal flexure is identified at the infracolic compartment.
The ligament of Treitz is identified and incised taking care not to injure the inferior mesenteric
vein. Two pairs of intestinal occlusion clamps are applied about 10 cm from the D-J flexure
and the jejunum is transected. The mesentery of the proximal jejunum is incised close to the
jejeunal wall taking care not to injure the superior mesenteric artery or vein.A double row of
short vessels runs from the fourth part of duodenum to the uncinate processes. These vessels
are dissected, ligated and divided.
Once these vessels are divided, the divided jejunum may now be brought to the right behind
the superior mesenteric vessels.
 Division of uncinate process: At this stage the only attachment of the specimen is between
the uncinate process and the superior mesenteric vessels. There are multiple short vessels
runing between the uncinate process and the superior mesenteric vessels. These vessels
are dissected in small bits, ligated and divided, taking care not to injure the superior
mesenteric vessels.
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 989
 Removal of specimen: Once the uncinate
process is cleared off from the superior
mesenteric vessels ,the specimen consisting of
gallbladder, common bile duct, distal third of
the stomach, head , neck and uncinate process
of the pancreas, whole of duodenum, proximal
10 cm of jejunum along with regional lymph
nodes are now free to be removed.
 Reconstruction: Once resection is complete
reconstruction is to be done to maintain
pancreatic, biliary and gastric continuity.
Pancreaticojejunal anastomosis: The jejeunal
loop is lengthened by dividing the vascular
arcade in the mesentery taking care to
maintain the vascularity at the cut end of the
jejunum. The cut end of the jejunum is closed by
2 layers of sutures, inner through and through
layers taking all coats of jejunum with 3-0
polyglactin sutures. Outer seromuscular
layer with 3-0 interrupted mersilk sutures.
The jejunal limb is brought up through a rent
in the transverse mesocolon in an avascular
area to the right of middle colic vessels.
 An end to side pancreaticojejunal
anastomosis is done in 2 layers. Interrupted
4–0 PDS sutures are applied between the
posterior pancreatic capsule with the
posterior seromuscular coat of jejunum.
 A jejunotomy is made at the level of
pancreatic duct. Using 4–0 PDS suture the
pancreatic duct mucosa is sutured to the all
coat of the jejeunum first applied posteriorly
and then anteriroly.
 The anastomosis is completed b y
interrupted sutures using 4-0 PDS apposing
the anterior pancreatic capsule with anterior
seromuscular coat of jejunum.
 Hepaticodochojejunostomy: About 15 cm
distal to the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis
an end to side hepaticodochojejunostomy is
done. A jejunotomy is made in the jejunum
matching the hepatic duct diameter. A single
layer anastomosis is done by taking all coat
of jejunum and the hepatic duct with interrupted 4-0 PDS sutures.
 Gastrojejunal anastomosis: About 15 cm distal to the hepaticodochojejunostomy an end to
side gastrojejunal anastomosis is done in 2 layers. The posterior seromuscular suture is applied
figure 22.6: Structures that are to be removed
in Whipple’s operation are shown to the right
of superior mesenteric artery
figure 22.7: Structures as seen before anastomosis
990 Section 9 Operative Surgery
first by a runing 4-0 PDS suture. The gastrotomy
is partially closed by all coat runing suture with
4-0 PDS, leaving about 5 cm for anastomosis.
The posterior through and the anterior through
suture is applied by runing 4-0 PDS sutures
taking all coat bite of the stomach and jejunum.
The anastomosis is completed by applying runing
anterior seromuscular layer with 4-0 PDS.
 Closure of transverse mesocolon rent : The
rent in the transverse mesocolon is sutured
to the seromuscular coat of the jejunum with
interrupted 3-0 mersilk to prevent internal
herniation through the mesocolon rent.
 Feeding jejunostomy: A feeding jejunostomy
is done 15 cm distal to the gastrojejunal
anastomosis. A no. 20 Fr. Foleys catheter is
used for creating a feeding jejunostomy and the
catheter brought out through a stab wound.
This is useful for maintaining nutrition in
postoperative period in situation of delayed
gastric emptying or development of pancreatic
fistula.
 Placement of drain: A wide bore drain is placed in the heaptorenal pouch of Morrison close to
the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis.
 Closure of abdomen: Surgical peritoneum with linea alba in single layer with runing suture
using 1 polypropylene or 1 PDS suture. Skin apposed with interrupted 2-0 monofilament
polyamide sutures.
The jejunostomy tube and the drainage tube is fixed to the skin.




procedure 13: Describe the steps of lateral pancreaticojejunostomy.
 Anesthesia: GA with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of the patient: Supine.
 Antiseptic cleaning with povidone iodine and draping by placement sterile sheets.
 Incision: A roof top or chevron incision gives very good exposure. In patient with narrow costal
margin a long upper midline incision extending from below the xiphoid to about 4 cm below
the umbilicus also gives adequate exposure.
 Preliminary exploration of abdomen: On opening the peritoneum the abdomen is explored
for diagnosis of any unforseen pathology. Pancreas is palpated for confirmation of diagnosis.
 Exposure of pancreas: The gastrocolic omentum is divided in between ligature and the body
and tail of pancreas is exposed. The head of pancreas is exposed by dividing the duodenocolic
ligament and reflecting the right colic flexure downwards. While doing so the right gastroepiploic
vein needs dissection and division after ligature.The small branches of gastroduodenal artery
also needs division for exposure of the entire head of the pancreas.

(2) Pancreatojejunostomy. (3) Gastrojejunostomy
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 991
 Kocherization of duodenum: An incision is made in the posterior parietal peritoneum at
the lateral border of 2nd part of duodenum and the duodenum kocherized lifting it up from
the inferior vena cava and posterior abdominal wall. The head of the pancreas can now be
palpated properly.
 Exposure of body and tail of pancreas: The gastrocolic ligament is divided in between ligature
and the body and tail of pancreas is exposed.
 Identification and opening of pancreatic duct: A grossly dilated duct with calculi in lumen
can be easily palpated. If the duct is not palpable a hypodermic needle is inserted into the
pancreatic parenchyma lateral to the neck of the pancreas at the upper 1/3rd and lower 2/3rd
junction. As the needle reaches the pancreatic duct pancreatic juice will start flowing out. The
needle is kept in that position.Following the shaft of the needle the pancreatic parenchyma is
incised with a diathermy knife and the pancreatic duct is opened up. A metal dilator is inserted
through the opened duct towards the body and tail of the pancreas and the duct is opened by
incising the pancreatic parenchyma using a diathermy knife to minimize bleeding. The dilator
is then inserted towards the head of the pancreas and the duct is opened similarly keeping 1
cm margin from the medial border of the duodenum to prevent injury to the vessels lying in
the pancreaticoduodenal groove.
 Removal of ductal calculi: Using Desjardins choledocholithotomy forceps all the stones and
debris are cleared from the pancreatic duct. Some stones and debris may be cleared by irrigating
the duct lumen with saline.
 Pancreatic head coring: For adequate pain relief a proper head coring is also required. The
thickened pancreatic parenchymal tissue of the head of pancreas is excised in piecemeal using
electrocautery keeping a 1cm rim of tissue around the medial border of the duodenum.
 Creation of a Roux-en-Y loop of jejunum: A Roux-en-Y limb of jejunum is created about 15 cm.
distal to the duodenojejunal flexure. The vessels in the mesentery are divided in such a fashion
so that blood supply to both the proximal and distal limb is well maintained.The jejunum is
divided and the cut end of the distal jejunal limb is closed by 3-0 polydioxanone (PDS) sutures
in 2 layers (inner through and through layers and outer interrupted seromuscular layers.).
 Pancreaticojejunal anastomosis: The distal limb of the Roux-en-Y loop is brought up behind
the transverse colon through an avascular area in the mesocolon to the right of middle colic
vessels (space of Riolan).
The jejunum is placed by the side of the opened pancreatic duct. A longitudinal jejunotomy is
made along the antimesnteric border matching the opening in the pancreatic duct. A single layer
pancreaticojejunal anastomosis is done by interrupted through and through stitches taking
bites in all layers of jejunum and the pancreatic parenchyma and the duct mucosa using 4-0
PDS suture.
(Alternatively a 2 layer anastomosis may be done. A outer layer of continuous suture taking
seromuscular coat of jejunum and the pancreatic parenchyma using 4-0 mersilk. An inner
layer of interrupted suture taking jejunal mucosa and the pancreatic duct mucosa using 4-0
PDS suture.)
 Closure of mesocolon rent: The mesocolon rent is closed by taking interrupted suture between
the margin of the mesocolon rent and the jejunal serosa.
 Jejunojeunal anastomosis: The intestinal continuity is maintained by doing a jejunojejunal
anastomosis about 35 cm distal to the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis. Single layer
jejunojejunal anastomosis is done with interrupted all coat stitch using 4-0 PDS sutures.

 Closure of jejunal mesenteric gap: The mesenteric gap between the proximal and the distal
jejunum loop is apposed by interrupted sutures using 3–0 mersilk
 Placement of drain: Check for hemostasis and a wide bore abdominal drain (No. 32 Fr.) is
placed in the hepatorenal pouch of Morrison.
 Closure: Closure in layers. The internal oblique, transversus abdominis and the surgical
peritoneum laterally and the posterior rectus sheath medially is apposed by continuous suture
using No.1 PDS suture.
The external oblique muscle and aponeurosis laterally and the anterior rectus sheath medially
is apposed by a continuous suture using 1 PDS suture.
The skin is approximated by interrupted 2-0 monofilament polyamide sutures.

epicolic, paracolic, intermediate and central lymph nodes (lymph nodes around the origin
of superior mesenteric vessels).
 Assessment of the local growth to decide about the resectability. Assess whether the
growth has invaded the posterior abdominal wall, ureter, gonadal vessels and duodenum
and pancreas. Any adherence of small gut to the growth.
 Exteriorization of small gut: For ease of dissection the whole of small gut is exteriorized and
wrapped in a moist towel taking care not to twist the mesentery.
 Division of greater omentum: The greater omentum is ligated and divided close to the greater
curvature of stomach preserving the gastroepiploic arcade.
 Mobilization of right colon: The cecum and the ascending colon is retracted medially and
the peritoneum is incised using diathermy along the white line of toldt at the right paracolic
gutter.The right colon along with the terminal ileum is reflected towards the left to expose the
vessels supplying the right colon—ileocolic, right colic and the middle colic vessels. While
doing so, care is taken to prevent injury to the structures lying deep to the right colon—
gonadal vessels, right ureter and the duodenum. Small bleeding in the retroperitoneum may
be controlled by placement of a moist mop.
 Divisions of vessels of right colon: The vessels supplying the terminal 10 cm of ileum are
dissected, ligated and divided. The ileocolic vessels and the right colic vessels are ligated as
high as possible. The right branch of the middle colic vessels are ligated close to its origin
from the trunk of middle colic artery. The mesentery inbetween these vessels are divided
and taken with the specimen.
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 993
 Dissection of lymph nodes: While dissecting and ligating the vessels all the lymph nodes along
these vessels are dissected and taken along with the specimen. The lymph nodes around the
trunk and origin of the superior mesenteric trunk is also dissected and removed along with
the specimen.
 Division of terminal ileum and the transverse colon: two pairs of intestinal occlusion clamps are
applied at the site of proposed ileal resection and the ileum is resected using cutting diathermy.
 Division of transverse colon: two pairs of intestinal occlusion clamps are applied at the site of
proposed transverse colon resection and the colon is divided using cutting diathermy. care

procedure 15:Describe the steps of anterior resection (or low anterior resection).
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of patient: Growth in upper rectum if hand sewn anastomosis is contemplated patient
should be in supine.
 For growth in midrectum or lower rectum, if the decision might change to APR during
operation or anastomosis is contemplated with a circular stapler patient should be in modified
lithotomy position.
 Incision: A lower midline incision from just above the symphysis pubis to about 5cm above
the umbilicus.The skin subcutaneous tissue, linea alba and surgical peritoneum is incised in
the same line.
 Exploration of abdomen:
•	 Assessment for presence of ascites, any distant spread to liver,omentum, peritoneum and
pelvis. Palpate for involvement of regional lymph nodes—pararectal lymph nodes and
central lymph nodes (lymph nodes around the origin of inferior mesenteric artery).

has invaded the posterior or lateral pelvic wall and ureter.
994 Section 9 Operative Surgery
 Exteriorization of small gut: The whole small gut is delivered ouside and kept wrapped in moist
towel taking care not to twist the mesentery.
 Mobilization of sigmoid and descending colon: The mobilization starts on the left side of the
pelvic brim. The left leaf of mesosigmoid is incised close to the pelvic brim in an avascular
area. This incision is taken upwards towards the splenic flexure. The avascular plane between
the mesosigmoid and the posterior pelvic wall is being entered by sharp dissection and the
rectosigmoid junction along with superior rectal vessels are lifted up. The left ureter crossing the
apex of the mesosigmoid is safeguarded during this dissection. The right leaf of the mesosigmoid
is then incised going upwards up to the bifurcation of aorta and going down up to the point in
lateral pelvic wall where the mesosigmoid reaches the lateral pelvic wall peritoneum. During
this dissection the right ureter is safeguarded.
 Mobilization of splenic flexure and descending colon: The lateral peritoneum along the line of
Toldt is incised taking this incision upwards up to the splenic flexure. The leinocolic and the
renocolic ligaments are then divided and the splenic flexure brought down to ensure a tension
free colorectal anastomosis.
Ligation of inferior mesenteric vessels and lymphatic dissection. The inferior mesenteric artery
is dissected close to its origin at the aorta and the lymph nodes around are dissected towards
the colon. The inferior mesenteric artery is dissected beyond the origin of the left colic artery,
ligated and divided. The inferior mesenteric vein is dissected near the duodenojejunal flexure,
ligated and divided close to the lower border of the pancreas and the lymphatic tissue around
this is taken down with the colon.
The lymphatic tissue around the bifurcation of the aorta and the common iliac vessels are taken
down towards the specimen. The intervening mesentery is divided.
Mobilization of the mesorectum and the rectum: This is the most important step in anterior
resection
•	 Posterior or presacral dissection: The mobilized sigmoid colon is drawn upwards and
forwards which opens up the presacral space.The avascular areolar tissue which surrounds
the mesorectum is identified and divided by sharp dissection. This dissection is initially
carried downwards in the midline along the curve of the sacrum up to the coccyx. Beyond
this the dissection carried forwards in front of the anococcygeal raphe dividing the Waldeyer’s
fascia. This dissection has to be done in proper plane preserving the presacral vessels and
nerves.
•	 Lateral dissection: The dissection from the posterior midline is carried around the lateral wall
of the mesorectum and sharp dissection is done along the lateral pelvic wall.The dissection is
first done on the left side and the lateral ligament is put on stretch by retracting the rectum
towards the right. A right angled forceps is used to dissect the lateral ligament and the right
angled forceps is passed around the lateral liagment which is divided by using diathermy.
Sometimes the middle rectal vessles runing along the lateral ligament needs ligature and
division. With similar maneuver the right lateral ligament is divided. While dividing the
lateral ligament the ureter and the hypogastric nerves are taken care of to prevent injury
to these structures.
•	 Anterior dissection: The anterior dissection is different in male and female patients.
In male patient: The bladder is retracted anteriorly by a Llyod Davis retractor or a Deavers
retractor and the peritoneum lining the rectovesical pouch is incised. This peritoneal incision is
extended laterally to the lateral pelvic wall. The posterior leaf of the incised peritoneum along
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 995
with the Denonvillier’s fascia is picked up with a long hemostatic forceps and retracted in an
upwards and posterior direction. By sharp dissection (using diathermy or a Metzenbaum
scissor), the rectum along with the mesorectum is separated from the seminal vesicle and the
prostate. Few bleeding vessels during this dissection may be controlled by diathermy.
In female: Then uterus is retracted anteriorly and the peritoneum of the rectouterine pouch
(pouch of Douglas) is incised and the incision is carried on either side to the lateral pelvic wall.
The posterior leaf of the incised peritoneum along with Denonvillier’s fascia is picked up by a
long hemostatic forceps and retracted in a posterior and cephalad direction and the rectum
along with mesorectum is separated from the cervix and the posterior vaginal wall, small
bleeding during this dissection may be controlled by using diathermy.
 Division of proximal colon: (The extent of colonic resection for anterior resection is 7 cm
proximal to the proximal margin of the growth. The distal margin for anterior resection is 5
cm from the distal margin of the grwoth. For low anterior resection this margin may be as low
as 2 cm. In ultralow anterior resection even a 1 cm distal margin is acceptable.)
At the point of proposed resction of proximal colon, the marginal artery is dissected, ligated and
divided. Two pairs of intestinal occlusion clamps are applied at the site of proposed resection of
colon and the proximal colon is divided by cutting diathermy inbetween the intestinal occlusion
clamps.
 Division of rectum: At the point of proposed rectal resection, the superior rectal artery is dissected
and ligated close to the rectal wall. A C shaped occlusion clamp is applied around the rectum
distally and an intestinal occlusion clamp is applied proximally and the rectum is divided
inbetween using cutting diathermy. The specimen is removed.
 Colorectal anastomosis
 Hand sewn anastomosis: A single layer colorectal anastomosis is done with interrupted suture
using 4-0 polydioxanone or mersilk suture either by full thickness suture or extramucosal suture.
 Stapler anastomosis: In low or ultralow anterior resection a stapler anastomosia is preferable.
This is done by using a circular stapler. The rectal stump is closed by applying a purse string
suture using 1-0 polypropylene suture. The anvil of the circular stapler is passed into the
proximal cut end of the colon and the end of colon closed around the anvil by a purse string
suture. The handle of the circular stapler is passed through the anal canal and delivered
through the rectal stump by a sharp puncture. The anvil is fitted into the handle of the circular
stapler. The stapler knob is gradually closed whereby the colonic end is brought closer to the
rectal stump. Once the indicator in the stapler shows that is in the firing range. The stapler is
unlocked and fired. This will create colorectal anastomosis. Once the anastomosis is done the
stapler is opened up by turning the knob one and half turn and the stapler is delivered out
through the anal canal.
 Checking the donuts: The anvil is opened up and the donut is examined. Two complete donut
indicates that a proper anastomosis has been done.
 Testing the anastomsis: An intestinal occlusion clamp is applied to the colon proximal to the
anastomosis. Pour normal saline into the pelvis so that the site of anastomosis remains under
the saline. Using a 50 mL syringe air is pushed into the rectum through the anal canal. Look
for any air bubble escaping through the anastomsis. In perfect anastomosis there should be no
leakage of air through the anastomsis.
 Proximal diversion colostomy or ileostomy: When there is any doubt regarding the colorectal
anastomosis, a proximal diversion transverse colostomy or ileostomy is preferable to safeguard
the anastomosis.
996 Section 9 Operative Surgery
 Placement of drain: Hemostasis is checked and a tube drain is placed inside the pelvis.
 Closure of abdomen: The surgical peritoneum and linea alba in single layer using no.1 loop
polydioxanone suture. Skin closed with interrupted suture using monofilament polyamide
sutures.





procedure 16:Describe the steps of abdominoperineal resection.
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of patient: Patient is placed in a modified lithotomy Trendelenburg position. The
operating surgeon stands on the left side of the patient. Operation is simultaneously done by
two teams of surgeons.
 Antiseptic cleaning and draping of both abdomen and perineal area with povidone-iodine
and draping done to expose the abdomen and perianal area.
 Incision: A midline incision is made starting just above the symphysis taking the incision up to
the right of umbilicus to about 5 cm above the umbilicus. The subcutaneous tissue, linea alba
and the surgical peritoneum is incised in the same line.
 Exploration of abdomen: A self-retaining retractor is applied for better exposure. General
exploration of abdomen to assess for any ascites, omentum,peritoneal surface, pelvis and liver
for any metastasis. Assess the regional lymph nodes for any enlargements. Palpate the rest of
the large gut for any evidence of synchronous growth.
Assess the rectal growth for deciding about resectability. If the tumor is fixed to the prostate,
seminal vesicle or the growth is fixed to the sacrum posteriorly, it is not wise to procced with
resection.
 Mobilization of sigmoid colon: The sigmoid colon is lifted up and towards the right. The left leaf
of the mesosigmoid is incised at its apex and the incision is carried upwards up to the sigmoid
colon and descending colon junction and carried distally up to the base of the bladder in male
(in female up to the lateral margin of posterior vaginal wall). During this dissection, the left
ureter crossing the sigmoid mesocolon is taken care of. The sigmoid colon is lifted up from the
posterior pelvic wall by sharp disection. The sigmoid colon is then retracted up and towards
the left and the right leaf of the mesosigmoid is incised. This incision is carried up up to the
bifurcation of the aorta and carried below around the lateral pelvic wall up to the base of the
bladder in male (in female up to the lateral margin of posterior vaginal wall).While doing so
the right ureter is taken care of. The peritoneal incision is joined anteriorly across the base of
the bladder in male and in female around the posterior vaginal wall.
 Ligation of inferior mesenteric vessels and lymphatic dissection: The inferior mesenteric artery
is dissected close to its origin at the aorta and the lymph nodes around are dissected towards
the colon. The inferior mesenteric artery is dissected beyond the origin of the left colic artery,
ligated and divided. The inferior mesenteric vein is dissected near the duodenojejunal flexure,
ligated and divided close to the lower border of the pancreas.
The lymphatic tissue around the origin of inferior mesenteric artery and lymph nodes around
the bifurcation of the aorta and the common iliac vessels are taken down towards the specimen.
The intervening mesentery is divided.
•	 Mobilization of the mesorectum and the rectum: This is the most important step in
abdominoperineal resection
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 997
•	 Posterior or presacral dissection: The mobilized sigmoid colon is drawn upwards and
forwards which opens up the presacral space.The avascular areolar tissue which surrounds
the mesorectum is identified and divided by sharp dissection. This dissection is initially
carried downwards in the midline along the curve of the sacrum up to the coccyx. Beyond
this, the dissection carried forwards in front of the anococcygeal raphe dividing the
waldeyer’s fascia. This dissection has to be done in proper plane preserving the presacral
vessels and nerves.
•	 Lateral dissection: The dissection from the posterior midline is carried around the lateral wall
of the mesorectum and sharp dissection is done along the lateral pelvic wall.The dissection is
first done on the left side and the lateral ligament is put on stretch by retracting the rectum
towards the right. A right angled forceps is used to dissect the lateral ligament and the right
angled forceps is passed around the lateral liagment which is divided by using diathermy.
Sometimes the middle rectal vessles runing along the lateral ligament needs ligature and
division. With similar maneuver the right lateral ligament is divided. While dividing the
lateral ligament the ureter and the hypogastric nerves are taken care of to prevent injury
to these structures.
•	 Anterior dissection: The anterior dissection is different in male and female patients.
In male patient: The bladder is retracted anteriorly by a Llyod Davis retractor or a Deavers
retractor and the peritoneumm lining the rectovesical pouch is incised. This peritoneal incision
is extended laterally to the lateral pelvic wall. The posterior leaf of the incised peritoneum along
with the Denonvillier’s fascia is picked up a long hemostatic forceps and retracted in an upwards
and posterior direction. By sharp dissection (using diathermy or a Metzenbaum scissor), the
rectum along with the mesorectum is separated from the seminal vesicle and the prostate. Few
bleeding vessels during this dissection may be controlled by diathermy.
In female: Then uterus is retracted anteriorly and the peritoneum of the rectouterine pouch
(Pouch of Douglas) is incised and the incision is carried on either side to the lateral pelvic wall.
The posterior leaf of the incised peritoneum along with Denonvillier’s fascia is picked up by a
long hemostatic forceps and retracted in a posterior and cephalad direction and the rectum
along with mesorectum is separated from the cervix and the posterior vaginal wall, Small
bleeding during this dissection may be controlled by using diathermy.
 Division of sigmoid colon: The point of division of sigmoid colon is 7 cm proximal to the
proximal margin of the growth. Adequate length of sigmoid (about 5 cm) is required to create
an end sigmoid colostomy. At the proposed site of sigmoid transection, the marginal artery is
dissected, ligated and divided. Two pairs of intestinal occlusion clamps are applied and the
sigmoid colon divided inbetween using cutting diathermy.
 Perineal dissection: The perineal dissection ideally starts when the abdominal surgeon has
decided about the resectability of the tumor and the abdominal and perineal dissection should
proceed simultaneously.
A purse string suture is applied around the anal orifice.
 Perineal incision: An elliptical incision is made around the anal orifice and the incision is
extended anteriorly 3–4 cm from the anal verge and posteriorly the incision is extended up to
the tip of the coccyx.
 Lateral dissection: The medial leaf of the incised skin margin is lifted up and medially by using
a pair of Allis tissue forceps and the lateral skin leaf is retracted laterally by using a skin hook.
The incision is deepened into the perirectal fat up to the pelvic diaphragm (Levator ani). The
anterior and posterior branches of inferior hemorrhoidal vessels which runs in the ischiorectal
fossa below the levator ani are coagulated and divided.This dissection is done on either side.
998 Section 9 Operative Surgery
 Posterior dissection: The posterior leaf of the skin margin is lifted up posteriorly and the incision
is deepened down. The anococcygeal ligament is divided using diathermy.A dense layer of
fascia (Waldeyer’s fascia attaches the posterior rectum and mesorectum to the presacral
and precoccygeal area. The anal canal is lifted and the Waldeyer’s fascia is divided using
electrocautery and this dissection is continued upwards in the presacral space till the perineal
surgeon reaches the area reached by the abdominal surgeon.
 Division of levator ani: The index finger is inserted through the presacral area and the finger
is swept across the superior aspect of the levator ani muscle on each side of the pelvis and
levator ani muscle is divided on either side of the lateral pelvic wall. The puborectalis muscle
is also divided.
 Anterior dissection: The anterior incision is deepened along a plane at the posterior border of
deep transverse perinei muscle. The rectourethralis muscle is divided.
 In male: The attachment of anterior mesorectum to the prostate and seminal vesicle has already
been divided by the abdominal surgeon. The remaining attachement of the anterior mesorectum
to the neck of the prostate is dissected from the perineal side. Once the mesorectum is dissected
all around the specimen is now free to be removed from the perineal side.
 In female: The attachment of the anterior mesorectum to the posterior vaginal wall is divided
till the area reached by the abdominal surgeon is met. Once the mesorectum is dissecteds all
around the specimen is removed from the perineal side.
 Closure of the perineal incision: The perineal wound is irrigated. A suction drainage tube is placed
in the perineal wound which is brought out through the posterior aspect of the perineal wound.
The muscles of the pelvic floor does not require to be sutured in the midline.The ischiorectal fat
pad and subcutanoeus tissue of the pelvis is apposed with 2-0 polyglactin sututres.
Skin is apposed with interrupted 2-0 monofilament polyamide suture. The skin may also be
apposed by subcuticular suture. (If there is gross contamination, the perineal wound may be
kept open by placement of a gauze pack.)
 Constructiuon of end sigmoid colostomy: The ideal site of colostomy should be marked before
the operation starts. The colostomy should be located in left lower quadrant of the abdomen.
The colostomy should be placed at the junction of medial 1/3rd and lateral 2/3rd junction
of left spinoumbilical line. At the site of proposed colostomy, the skin is picked up by a pair
of Allis tissue forceps and a circle of skin is excised appropriate to the diameter of colon. The
subcutaneous tissue is incised.
 A cruciate incision is made over the anterior rectus sheath. The rectum abdominis muscle is
split by using a straight hemostatic forceps.
 The posterior rectus sheath is picked up by 2 pairs of hemostatic forceps and the posterior rectus
sheath along with peritoneum is incised.
 The cut end of the sigmoid colon is brought out through this wound by using a Babcock’s tissue
forceps, taking care so that there is no rotation of the end of the sigmoid colon. The colon is
fixed to the anterior rectus sheath using interrpted 2-0 polyglactin sutures. The colostomy is
constructed by taking interrupted suture with 3-0 polyglacitn suture, taking all coats of the
sigmoid colon and the subcutaneous tissue.
 Closure of lateral space: The lateral space between the exteriorized sigmoid colon is obliterated
by taking few interrupted suture between the seromuscular coat of the sigmoid colon and
the posterior parietal peritoneum. This prevents development of internal herniation in
postoperative period.
 Abdominal closure: The pelvic cavity is irrigated with normal saline. The pelvic peritoneum is
apposed by suturing with 2-0 polyglactin sutures.
The surgical peritoneum and linea is apposed by suturing with No. 1 polypropylene or No. 1
PDS suture. The skin is apposed with interrupted monofilament polyamide sutures.



procedure 17:Describe the steps of transverse colostomy.
 indications of transverse colostomy:
•	 to relieve left colonic obstruction.
•	 For fecal diversion to safeguard against leakage following low anterior resection or left
colonic anastomosis.
•	 Fecal diversion in patient with rectovaginal fistula or Hirschsprung’s disease.
 Anaesthesia: General anesthesia. May also be done under regional or local anesthesia.
 Position of patient—supine.
 Antiseptic cleaning and draping.
 Skin incision: The site of the colostomy should be planned well before the operation. The ideal
site of right transverse colostomy is at the right upper quadrant of the abdomen at a point
midway between the right subcostal margin and the umbilicus over the rectus abdominis
muscle.
A transverse incision is made at a point midway between the right costal margin and the
umbilicus. The incision extends medially 2 cm to the right of midline and laterally extending
just beyond the lateral border of the rectus sheath. The subcutaneous tissue is incised in the
same line.
 Incising the anterior and posterior rectus sheath and the peritoneum: A cruciate incision is
made over the anterior rectus sheath. The rectus abdominis muscle is exposed. The rectus
abdominis muscle is split by inserting a Kelly hemostatic forceps and the posterior rectus
sheath is exposed. The posterior rectus is lifted up by two pairs of hemostatic forceps and
incised inbetween. The peritoneal opening is stretched by inserting two fingers.
 Delivery of the transverse colon: The transverse colon is identified by looking at taenia coli,
haustration and attachment of the greater omentum and transverse mesocolon.The greater
omentum attached to the transverse colon is divided close to the colon for about 6–7 cm and
the transverse mesocolon is identified. The antimesenteric border of the transverse colon
is held up by a pair of Babcock forceps and delivered out in the wound. The loop of colon
should remain out of the wound without any tension.
 Insertion of a colostomy device through the transverse mesocolon: The transverse colon is
pulled up and a rent is made in the transverse mesocolon in an avascular area close to the
mesenteric border of the colon and a plastic colostomy device is passed through the rent to
keep the colon in place so that it does not retract.
 Fixation of the colon: The projecting colon is fixed to the anterior rectus sheath by few
interrupted suture using 2-0 polyglactin sutures.
 Construction of colostomy: A 5 cm long incision is made in the colon along the taenia coli.
The edges of the colon are turned back and the cut margin of the colon is sutured to the
subcutaneous tissue by interrupted 3-0 polyglactin sutures.
A colostomy bag may be applied to the skin around the colostomy so that the opening in the
bag snugly fits around the opened up colon.
Skin closure: The remaining skin incision site is apposed by interrupted monofilament
polyamide suture.



procedure 18:Describe the steps of closure of colostomy.
Before closure of colostomy the primary cause has to be treated.
The distal colon should be assessed by either colonoscopy or radiographic examination with
barium (distal cologram) to assess patency of the distal colon up to the rectum.
 Anaesthesia: Regional anesthesia.
 Antiseptic cleaning and draping.
 Mobilization of the colostomy: 6-8 interrupted 3-0 mersilk sutures are inserted around the
mucocutaneous junction of colostomy. These sutures are kept long and held up by a number
of haemostatic forceps for traction. An incision is made around the edge of the colostomy
taking about 2 mm fringe of skin around the colostomy. if required, the incision may be
extended on either side in a transverse plane.
 traction is applied in the sutures already placed around the colostomy, and the colon
is dissected all around up to the rectus sheath. The dissection is done further up to the
peritoneum and the peritoneum is opened all round and the colon is mobilized well.
 Freshening the margin of colostomy: The fringe of skin around the colostomy is excised up to
the margin of mucosa and the mucosa of the colon is freed all around.
 Closure of colon: The incision in the colon is closed with interrupted sutures taking all coats
with 3-0 polydioxanone suture. The apposition may also be done with interrupted sutures
taking the seromuscular coats (extramucosal stitch).
 Closure of abdominal wound: Single layer closure of posterior and anterior rectus sheath
with runing 1 PDS suture.
Skin apposed with interrupted monofilament polyamide sutures.



procedure 19:Describe the steps of appendicectomy.
 General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation (Appendicectomy may also be done under
regional anesthesia—spinal or epidural).
 Position of the patient—supine.
 Antiseptic cleaning and draping.
 Incision: McBurneys’ gridiron incision. An oblique skin incision of about 3 inches (one
inch above and two inches below the spinoumbilical line) is made at right angle to the
right spinoumbilical line passing through the McBurneys’ point (Fig. 22.9A). The skin and
subcutaneous tissues are incised in the same line.
 Division of external oblique aponeurosis: A nick is made in the external oblique aponeurosis
and the external oblique aponeurosis is incised along the direction of its fibers (Fig. 22.9B).
 Splitting internal oblique and tranisversus abdominis muscle: The internal oblique muscle is
exposed and deep to it lies the transversus abdominis muscle. A Mayo’s scissor is thrushed
with the blades closed through the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscle
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 1001
and the blades are opened up to split both these muscles along the direction of their fibers
(Fig. 22.9c).
 Incising the peritoneum: two Langenbachs’ retractors are inserted deep to these muscles
and the peritoneum is exposed. The peritoneum is lifted by two pairs of hemostatic forceps
and a nick is made in the peritoneum and the peritoneal incision is then extended along the
line of skin incision (Fig. 22.9D).
 Identifying the cecum: As soon as peritoneum is opened turbid or clear fluid may escape from
the peritoneal cavity (This fluid may be due to peritoneal reaction to local inflammation).
The cecum is identified by its pale color, presence of taenia coli and absence of mesentery.

 Delivering the cecum and the appendix: The caecum is delivered into the wound by holding it
with a plain dissecting forceps. The caecum is grasped with a moist sponge and is delivered
into the wound further when the appendix will come into view. if appendix is not visible,
follow the anterior taenia coli in the caecum which will guide into the base of the appendix.
 Division of the mesoappendix: The appendix is held by Babcock’s tissue forceps—one applied
near the tip, one applied at the body of the appendix and another Babcock’s tissue forceps
applied at the base of the appendix. The mesoappendix is clamped with one or more pair of
hemostatic forceps and divided and ligated. Alternatively a mosquito hemostatic forceps is
thrushed through an avascular area in the mesoappendix near its base and a ligature passed
around the mesoappendix and ligated. The mesoappendix attached toward the appendix is
then divided (Fig. 22.9e).
 Division of the base of appendix: The base of the appendix is crushed by applying a hemostatic
forceps. A ligature of 1-0 chromic catgut is then passed around the base of the appendix at
the crushed area and the base of the appendix is ligated. A hemostatic forceps is applied at
the appendix about 5 mm distal to the site of ligature at the base of appendix. The appendix
is divided with a knife close to the forceps and the stump of the appendix is swabbed with
povidone iodine lotion (Fig. 22.9F).
The appendix, swab, knife with the hemostatic forceps which are contaminated are kept in
a bowl and removed from the operation field.
 Burying the base of appendix: Most surgeons do not invert the base of appendix routinely. if
the stump of the appendix is to be inverted, a purse string suture is applied on the cecal wall
around the base of the appendix. The stump of the appendix is held by a dissecting forceps
and the purse string suture is tightened and the stump of the appendix is inverted as the
purse string suture is tied (Figs 22.9G and H).
 Check for hemostasis: The mesoappendix stump is checked for bleeding.
 Look for Meckel’s diverticulum: Bring out the terminal ileum and look up to two feet from the
ileocaecal junction to exclude any associated Meckel’s diverticulum.
 Closure: The wound is closed in layer.



procedure 20:What are the indications of splenectomy?
 Splenic trauma: Severe degree of splenic injury requires splenectomy. Mild splenic trauma
may be managed with splenic conserving surgery.
 chronic hemolytic diseases like hereditary spherocytosis, thalassemia, sickle cell anemia.
 idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
 Hypersplenism causing pancytopenia due to portal hypertension, lymphomatous infiltration
or in leukemias.
 Splenic cysts, splenic abscess or tumors.
 incidental splenectomy in association with radical gastrectomy or shunt surgery for portal
hypertension.
Steps of splenectomy
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of the patient: Supine with a sand bag placed under the left side of the chest.
 Incision: Approach is either by a long midline or left subcostal incision (see abdominal
incision).
 Exploration: The spleen is examined. The liver, gallbladder and the bile duct are examined.
 in hemolytic anemias there may be stones in the gallbladder or in the common bile duct.
Thorough exploration of the abdomen is to be done for presence of any splenunculi or
lymphadenopathy.
 Mobilization of the spleen: The left hand is passed between the spleen and the diaphragm
and the spleen is drawn toward the abdominal incision. This maneuver brings the lieno-renal
ligament in view. The posterior leaf of the lienorenal ligament is incised with the scissors and
the spleen is mobilized and delivered into the abdominal wound.
 Division of splenic vessels: As the spleen is mobilized into the wound, the posterior surface of
the hilum of the spleen is dissected. The splenic vein and artery come into view. The splenic
artery is seen running along the upper border of the pancreas. The splenic artery is dissected
using a right angle forceps and three ligatures of no. 1 silk are passed around the artery and are
ligated. The splenic artery is divided inbetween the ligatures keeping two ligaturestoward the
proximal side. The splenic vein is dissected carefully taking care not to injure the pancreatic
tail. Three ligatures are passed around the splenic vein and the ligatures are tied. The splenic
vein is divided keeping two ligatures toward the portal vein side.
 Division of short gastric vessels: The short gastric vessels run in the gastrosplenic ligament.
The gastrosplenic ligament is divided inbetween series of hemostatic forceps and ligated
with no. 1-0 silk.
 Division of anterior leaf of lienorenal ligament: once the gastrosplenic ligament, splenic
vessels are divided and the pancreatic tail is dissected from the splenic hilum, the anterior
leaf of the lienorenal ligament is exposed. This is usually avascular and may be divided with
the scissors.
The spleen is now free to be removed.
1004 Section 9 Operative Surgery
 Placement of drain and closure: A suction drain is kept in the splenic bed and the abdomen
is closed in layers.
Postoperative management
 intravenous fluid to maintain hydration. iV fluid is continued till bowel sounds return.
This usually takes about 48–72 hours.
 nasogastric aspiration.
 Prophylactic antibiotics.
 Vaccination against Pneumococcal and H. influenza infection. 



procedure 21:What are the indications of nephrectomy?
 carcinoma of kidney
 Severe renal injury with avulsion of renal pedicle
 Hydronephrosis with nonfunctional kidney
 Renal calculus with gross destruction of kidney
 chronic pyelonephritis
 Pyonephrosis of kidney
 Donor nephrectomy for transplantation.
Nephrectomy through a loin incision:
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of the patient: For approach to the right kidney, patient lies in left lateral position.
The upper arm is supported on an arm rest and is used for venous cannulation and blood
pressure measurements. The left lower limb is kept flexed at the hip and knee to 90 degrees
and the right lower limb is kept extended supported on a pillow kept between the two legs.
The area between the right costal margin and the iliac crest is opened by lifting the kidney
bridge and breaking off the table towards the leg end. The position is maintained by a leather
strap or a broad band of adhesive strap fixing the iliac crest and the greater trochanter to the
operation table. The right shoulder is also anchored to the operation table by adhesive strap.
 Antiseptic dressing and draping?
 Skin incision: The skin incision starts from the angle between the 12th rib and the lateral
border of the erector spinae muscles and passes downward and forward about 1 cm below
the 12th rib to a point about 2 cm above and anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine up to
the lateral border of the rectus sheath.
The subcutaneous tissue is incised in the same line.
 Division of superficial muscles: in the posterior part of the wound, the latissimus dorsi muscle
is incised. in the anterior part of the wound, the external oblique muscle and the aponeurosis
is incised.
 in the posterior part of the wound once the latissimus dorsi is incised the serratus posterior
inferior muscle is exposed. The serratus posterior inferior muscle is also incised. At the
anterior part of the incision, the internal oblique muscle and aponeurosis is incised in the
same line.
 Division of thoracolumbar fascia: An incision is made in the thoracolumbar fascia taking care
not to injure the subcostal nerve. The incision is carried backward up to the lateral border of
the erector spinae muscle. Using a Gallies swab, with blunt dissection the parietal peritoneum
is stripped off from the transversus abdominis muscle.
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 1005
the transversus abdominis muscle is divided by carrying forward the incision in the
thoracolumbar fascia. Hemostasis is secured.
 Exposure of perinephric space: The cut margins of the thoracolumbar fascia is retracted and
the parietal peritoneum is further stripped off medially and the perinephric space is exposed.
 Incision of perirenal fascia: The perirenal fascia (fascia of Gerota) is lifted at the lateral aspect
with two pairs of hemostatic forceps and incised with a knife inbetween the hemostatic
forceps. The incision in the perirenal fascia is then extended with a scissors.
 Exposure of the kidney: once the perirenal fascia is incised the pale yellow perinephric fat is
exposed and deep to this fat lies the kidney.
 Mobilization of kidney: By blunt finger dissection, the kidney is mobilized. The lower pole,
posterior surface and the anterior surface of the kidney are mobilized. There may be an
accessory artery and vein at the lower pole while mobilizing. These vessels should be clamped
and divided.
 Division of the ureter: The upper ureter is identified, dissected and divided inbetween clamps
and the cut ends are ligated. The proximal ureter is followed up to the hilum.
 Division of the renal vessels: The renal artery lies posterior to the renal vein and approach
from the posterior aspect will allow better tackling of the artery. The artery should be ligated
before the vein to avoid congestion of blood in the kidney. A right angle forceps is used to
dissect and pass ligatures around the artery. Three ligatures are passed and the vessel is triply
ligated. The renal artery is divided keeping two ligatures toward the proximal side.
The renal vein is similarly dissected, triply ligated and divided keeping two ligatures toward
the inferior vena cava side.
 Mobilization of the upper pole of the kidney: After the renal vessels are ligated and divided,
the upper pole is mobilized separating the adrenal from the upper pole of the kidney by blunt
dissection taking care to avoid injury to the adrenal gland.
 Check for hemostasis: After the kidney is removed, the renal fossa is exposed well and
inspected carefully to look for any bleeding which may be controlled with diathermy or
ligature. A tube drain is kept in the renal fossa.

1006 Section 9 Operative Surgery
Raising of skin flaps (Figs 22.10B and C): The skin flaps are raised by sharp dissection with scalpel
or scissor in the plane between the subcutaneous fat and the mammary fat. The upper skin flap
is raised up to the clavicle and the lower skin flap is raised up to the upper quadrant of the rectus
sheath. The bleeding points are coagulated with diathermy taking care to avoid burn of the skin.
Raising the breast (Fig. 22.10D): The uppermost part of the breast is dissected off from the
fascia covering the pectoralis major. A cleavage is created between the breast tissue and the
fascia covering the pectoralis major and the whole breast is lifted off from the pectoralis major
fascia. The perforating vessels on the medial side is controlled with diathermy or are ligated. The
breast is lifted above from the level of the clavicle, below up to the upper quadrant of the rectus
sheath, medially up to the midline and laterally up to latissimus dorsi. The breast is allowed to
hang laterally keeping the axillary tail of the breast in continuity with the axillary lymph nodes.
Axillary dissection (Fig. 22.10E): The lateral border of the pectoralis major is cleared of the loose
areolar tissue and all the loose areolar tissue and level i lymph nodes in the axilla are cleared
taking care not to injure the axillary vessels and the nerves. The pectoralis minor muscle is
dissected and it is divided from its insertion into the coracoid process. The level ii and iii lymph
nodes are then dissected off from the axilla. The lateral dissection is carried up to the anterior
border of the latissimus dorsi. The clearence of the lymphatics and the loose areolar tissue is
kept confined to the anterior and inferior aspect of the axillary vein and no attempt is made
to clear the structures above the vein. The structures so separated are dissected away from the
chest wall by dissection using a peanut swab. The nerve to serratus anterior is identified along
the lateral chest wall and preserved. nerves to latissimus dorsi is identified running along the
subscapular vessels and preserved. The intercostobrachial nerve is dissected and preserved.
Hemostasis is secured.
Closure (Fig. 22.10F): A suction drain is inserted—one tube kept in the axilla and another tube
kept underneath the breast flap. The skin incision may be closed with a subcuticular sutures or
interrupted silk or nylon sutures. After skin closure the vacuum drain is activated and fluid is
squeezed out from beneath the skin flaps and the skin flaps adheres to the chest wall.
What structures are to be preserved during modified radical mastectomy?
1. Long thoracic nerve (supplies serratus anterior).
2. Thoracodorsal nerve (supplies latissimus dorsi).
3. cephalic vein.
4. Axillary vein.


Procedure 23:Describe the steps of lumbar sympathectomy.
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of patient: Supine with slight tilting by placing a pillow behind the loin on the side
of operation.
 Antiseptic dressing and draping.
 Incision: An oblique lumbar incision starting from the lateral border of the erector spinae
and then extended medially up to the lateral border of the rectus abdominis. The skin and
the subcutaneous tissues are incised in the same line.
 Division of abdominal flat muscles and aponeurosis: the external oblique muscle and
aponeurosis are incised in the same line as skin incision.
The internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles are cut in the same line.
 Stripping of the peritoneum: once the flat muscles are divided, the extraperitoneal fatty tissue
and the peritoneum is exposed. This layer is stripped off medially by dissecting with a swab
taking care not to open the peritoneum. if the peritoneum is opened inadvertently, it should
be sutured with 1-0 chromic catgut sutures.
 Identification of the sympathetic chain: The sympathetic chain is situated in the lateral side
of the body of the lumbar vertebrae medial to the medial margin of the psoas muscle. on the
right side, this is overlapped by the inferior vena cava and on the left side this is overlapped
by aorta.
The sympathetic chain is identified by the presence of ganglia and the rami communicantes
passing from the ganglia. The first lumbar ganglion is situated high up under cover of the crus
of the diaphragm and contains both gray and white rami communicantes. The white rami
communicans carries the preganglinic fibers and the gray rami communicantes carries the
postganglinic fibers.
For complete sympathetic denervation of the lower limb the l st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th lumbar
ganglia are to be removed. if bilateral sympathectomy is contemplated, the 1st lumbar
ganglion on one side is to be preserved. Bilateral division of 1st lumbar ganglion will result
in sterility due to paralysis of the ejaculatory mechanism.
 Dissection of the sympathetic chain: The first lumbar ganglion is identified and dissected by
using a right angled forceps and divided inbetween ligatures. The sympathetic trunk is then
dissected downwards up to the 4th lumbar ganglia lying behind the common iliac vessels
and divided in between ligatures at this point. While dissecting the sympathetic chain some
lumbar vessels might need ligature and division.
 Closure of incision in layers.



procedure 24:Describe the steps of total thyroidectomy
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
Position of patient: Patient is supine, neck extended by placing a pillow in—between the shoulder
blades and head resting on a ring.
Dressing and draping: Povidone iodine painting done from the level of the chin to the upper
chest. Three towel draping done for the head and operative area isolated by further placement
of draping.
Incision: The approach is through a cervical collar incision made 2 cm above the suprasternal
notch extending from posterior border of one sternocleidomastoid to the posterior border of
opposite sternocleidomastoid. The skin incision is marked by pressing with a thread on the skin
(Garrotte mark). The collar incision is made, the skin, superficial fascia and platysma are cut.
The platysma is incised at a little higher level than the skin (Fig. 22.11A).
Raising the skin flaps: The upper skin flap, superficial fascia and the platysma is dissected and
the upper flap is raised up to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. The lower flap of skin,
superficial fascia and the platysma is raised up to the suprasternal notch (Fig. 22.11B).
Incision of deep cervical fascia: The investing layer of the deep cervical fascia is incised in the
midline. if the anterior jugular veins come on the way, these may be ligated and divided (Fig.
22.11c).
Raising the fascial and strap muscles flap: The investing layer of the deep cervical fascia along
with the strap muscles are lifted up from the thyroid gland to expose the lateral lobes of the gland
covered by the pretracheal fascia (Fig. 22.11D). The pretracheal fascia is incised and the finger
passed around the plane between the pretracheal fascia and the thyroid gland. if the enlarged
lobes are large, the strap muscles may be divided at a upper level as the nerves enters the strap
muscles from below.
Division of the middle thyroid vein: The thyroid lobe is mobilized medially and the middle thyroid
vein is identified passing from the middle of the lateral lobe to the internal jugular vein. The
middle thyroid vein is dissected and divided in between ligatures (Fig. 22.11e).
Division of superior thyroid vessels: The muscles are retracted upwards and laterally and the
superior pole of lateral lobe of thyroid is exposed. The superior thyroid vessels are dissected close
to the upper pole of the lobe. The superior thyroid artery and vein should be ligated separately.
Three ligatures are passed around the superior thyroid artery, ligated and divided keeping two
ligatures towards the proximal side. The superior thyroid vein is ligated and divided similarly.
care should be taken to avoid damage to external laryngeal nerve (Fig. 22.11F).
Division of inferior thyroid artery: The gland is retracted medially and the branches of the inferior
thyroid artery are identified entering the lower pole of the thyroid lobe. At this stage the recurrent
laryngeal nerve is identified running vertically up along the tracheoesophageal groove. The
parathyroid glands are identified and preserved. The individual branches of the inferior thyroid
artery are identified and divided in between ligatures (Fig. 22.11G).
Division of inferior thyroid veins: The inferior thyroid veins emerge from the lower pole of the
lateral lobe. These veins are dissected and divided in between ligatures.
The dissection on the other side now divides the middle thyroid vein, superior thyroid vessels,
inferior thyroid artery branches and the inferior thyroid veins in the same way as done above.
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 1009
Dissection of the thyroid isthmus: The thyroid isthmus is dissected free from the trachea by using
a thyroid dissector. Arteria thyroidea ima if present should be dissected,ligated and divided.
once these vessels are ligated and divided, thyroid lobes and isthmus are attached to the
larynx and trachea by pretracheal fascia and Berry’s ligament. The small vessels from tracheal
and esophageal branches are cauterized and divided. The pretracheal fascia and Berry’s ligament
is then divided taking care not to injure the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
Control of bleeding and placement of drain: All bleeding points are checked and bleeding
controlled with ligatures or diathermy coagulation. two suction drainage tubes are kept one
each at the sites of resected lobe.

Closure: The investing layer of the deep fascia is apposed with interrupted 3-0 polyglactin sutures.
The platysma is apposed with 3-0 polyglactin sutures. The skin is apposed with interrupted
monofilament sutures or by subcuticular sutures.

procedure 25:Describe the steps of left hemithyroidectomy.
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of the patient: Patient supine with neck extended by placing a sand bag inbetween
the shoulder blades, head resting on head ring. The head end is elevated by about 15 degrees
to reduce the venous congestion.
 Antiseptic dressing and draping: Antiseptic cleaning with povidone iodine from chin to
midchest. Three towel draping for head area. A Mayo’s table is placed over the chest area
and draping done by placement of jaconate and sterile sheets.
 Incision: cervical collar incision along the skin crease 2 cm above the suprasternal notch
and extending from posterior border of one sternocleidomastoid to the posterior border of
opposite sternocleidomastoid. The skin incision is marked by pressing the line of incision
with a black silk thread (Garrotte mark).
The skin and subcutaneous tissue is incised and the platysma muscle is incised at little higher
level along the same line of skin incision.
 Raising of skin flaps: Both the upper and lower skin flaps is to be raised.
The upper skin flap is lifted up by applying a pair of sharp skin hook and dissection is carried
out in subplatysmal plane and the upper skin flap is lifted up up to the upper border of thyroid
cartilage.
The lower skin flap is lifted up similarly and the dissection done in subplatysmal level up to
the suprasternal notch. Small bleeding vessels may be controlled with electrocautery.
 Incising the investing layer of deep cervical fascia: once the skin flaps are raised these are held
up by applying a pair of Joll’s thyroid retractor and the skin flaps are retracted by opening
the Joll’s thyroid retractor. A nick is made in the investing layer of deep cervical facia in the
midline. The cut margins are picked up by two pairs of hemostatic forceps and the incision
extended above up to the upper border of thyroid cartilage and below up to the suprasternal
notch. if the anterior jugular vein comes in the way, this may be ligated and divided.
 Exposure of the thyroid lobe: The investing layer of deep cervical fascia is picked up by a
number of haemostatic forceps and the strap muscles (superficial—sternohyoid, omohyoid
and the deeper sternothyroid) are lifted up from the thyroid lobe by blunt dissection. once
this is done, the thyroid lobe covered by pretracheal fascia is exposed.
 if the thyroid lobe is hugely enlarged, for proper exposure the strap muscles may be divided
transversely at a higher level (as the nerve supply comes from below)
 Incising the pretracheal fascia: The pretracheal fascia covering the thyroid lobe is picked up
by hemostatic forceps and incised. A plane is created between the pretracheal fascia and the
thyroid lobe on the side to be operated.
 Division of middle thyroid vein: This is the first vessel to be tackled in thyroidectomy as it is a
slender vessel and is a direct tributary of internal jugular vein. The thyroid lobe is retracted
medially and the middle thyroid vein is identified emerging from the middle of the thyroid
lobe runing transversely into the internal jugular vein. The vein is dissected by a right angled
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 1011
forceps and two ligatures are passed around the vein, ligated and the vein is divided in
between two ligatures.
 Division of superior thyroid vessels: The strap muscles are retracted laterally and the thyroid
lobe is retracted downwards and medially to expose the superior pole of the lateral lobe
of the gland.The superior thyroid vessels are dissected close to the upper pole of the gland
taking care not to injure the external laryngeal nerve. The superior thyroid artery and vein
should be ligated separately. Three ligatures are passed around the superior thyroid artery,
ligated and divided keeping two ligatures towards the proximal side. The superior thyroid
vein is ligated and divided similarly.
 Division of inferior thyroid artery: The earlier concept was to tie the inferior thyroid artery away
from the gland to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. However, this is associated
with higher incidence of parathyroid infarction.
•	 The recent concept is to ligate the individual branches of the inferior thyroid artery close
to the gland. The thyroid lobe is retracted further medially and the parathyroid gland and
the recurrent laryngeal nerve is identified runing in the tracheoeosphageal groove. The
individual branches of the inferior thyroid artery is dissected using a right angled forceps,
ligated and divided inbetween ligature, taking care not to injure the recurrent laryngeal
nerve.
 Division of inferior thyroid vein: The inferior thyroid vein emerges from the lower pole of the
lateral lobe of the gland. The inferior thyroid veins are dissected with right angled forceps,
ligated and divided in between ligature.
 Dissection of thyroid isthmus: The thyroid lobe is dissected from the trachea and esophagus
by dividing the pretracheal fascia and the Berry’s ligament (thickening of pretracheal fascia
attached to the cricoid cartilage)
•	 The thyroid lobe is lifted up and medially. Lower pole of the isthmus is dissected from
the trachea and if an arteria thyroidea ima is present, this is to be dissected, ligated and
divided. The isthmus is dissected from the anterior surface of trachea. A pair of hemostatic
forceps is applied at the junction of the isthmus with opposite lobe and the isthmus is
divided with a knife, taking care not to injure the underlying trachea. The cut margin of
the isthmus is overrun with 3-0 polyglactin sutures.
 closure: check for hemostasis. Any bleeding needs to be controlled with diathermy or ligature.
 Placement of drain: A suction drain is placed in the neck at the site of resected lobe.
 closure: The investing layer of deep cervical fascia is approximated with interrupted 3-0
polyglactin sutures. The platysma is apposed by a runing 3-0 polyglactin suture. The skin is
apposed by subcuticular suture using 3–0 polyglactin.





procedure 26:Describe the steps of superficial parotidectomy
 General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of patient: Supine with neck extended by placing a sand bag below the shoulder blade.
Head resting on a head ring and turned to the opposite side of operation. Head end elevated
by 15 degree to reduce venous congestion. Eyes covered with a eye pad.
 Antiseptic cleaning and draping.
1012 Section 9 Operative Surgery
 Incision: An S shaped cervico-mastoid-facial incision is made. The incision starts below the
zygomatic arch taken infront of the tragus turns around the ear lobule bending backwards to
the mastoid process and then curves downwards transversely in the skin crease of the neck.
 Raising of skin flaps: The cervical, part of the incision is deepened first then the mastoid and
finally the facial part of the incision. The incision is deepened down to the subcutaneous tissue
and the platysma. The anterior skin flap is picked up by a sharp skin hook and the anterior skin
flap is raised by sharp dissection below the platysma up to the anterior border of the parotid
gland. Superiorly the skin flap is raised up to the zygomatic arch. The posterior skin flap along
with the ear lobule is lifted up to some extent to expose the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM)
and the mastoid processs, and cartilaginous part of the external auditory canal.
 Exposure and dissection of the posterior margin of the parotid gland: The external jugular
vein is dissected ligated and divided at the lower pole of the gland. The great auricular nerve
exposed may be divided if required for ease of subsequent dissection. The dissection is done
between the anterior border of SCM and the posterior border of the parotid gland upwards
to reach up to the mastoid process. Small bleeding vessels along the anterior border of SCM
needs control with electrocautery. The SCM is retracted laterally to expose the posterior belly
of digastric and the stylohyoid muscle.
 Identification of facial nerve: There is a dense layer of temporoparotid fascia which extends
from tympanomastoid fissure to the posterior border of parotid gland. This fascia is incised and
deep dissection is done along the anterior border of mastoid process. The assistant retract the
parotid gland medially. As the dissection is deepened there appears multiple small branches of
posterior auricular artery which needs electrocautery and division. The deep dissection is done
further to reach the junction of cartilaginous and bony part of the external auditory canal. The
facial nerve is identified emerging from the stylomastoid foramen lying infront of the styloid
process and at the junction of cartilaginous and bony part of the external auditory canal. The
nerve runs transversely or obliquely for about 1–2 cm and divides into temporofacial (upper)
and cervicofacial (lower) division and enters into the faciovenous plane of the parotid gland
dividing the gland into superficial and deep lobe.
Small bleeding vessels may be controlled with pressure packing or by use of bipolar diathermy.
 Dissection of facial nerve branches: All the facial nerve branches are traced from the point of
entry of the nerve into the gland up to its exit from the anterior border of the gland. A curved
mosquito forceps with concavity upwards is pushed between the nerve branch and the parotid
tissue of the superficial lobe infront in small bits and the overlying parotid tissue divided using
scissors or bipolar cautery. This is continued up to the anterior border of the gland. All the
nerve branches are dissected in the same way. The zygomatic branch is traced up towards the
zygomatic arch at the upper pole of the gland and the cervical branch is traced at the lower
pole towards the neck. The other branches are traced to the anterior border of the gland.
 Removal of superficial part of the gland: As all the nerve branches are dissected and the overlying
parotid tissue divided the whole of superficial part of the gland now lies free with attachement
of the parotid duct at the anterior border of the gland. The parotid duct is ligated at the anterior
border of masseter muscle and the superficial part of the gland is removed.
A suction drain is placed at the parotid fossa, brought out through a stab wound in the
anterior skin flap in the neck.
•	 Closure: Closure is done in single layer with interrupted 3-0 monofilament polyamide suture.
Alternatively the platysma may be apposed by 3-0 polyglactin suture and the skin apposed
by subcuticular suture using 3-0 polyglactin.




procedure 27:Describe the steps of submandibular sialoadenectomy
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of patient: Patient supine, neck extended by placing a sand bag inbetween shoulder
blades, head resting on head ring and chin turned to the opposite side. Head end elevated by
15 degrees to reduce venous congestion.
 Antiseptic cleaning with povidone iodine and draping. Head area draped with three towel
technique.
 Incision: A transverse neck crease skin incision is made 3–4 cm below the lower border of the
mandible medially extending up to 2 cm lateral to midline and laterally extending up to the
point below the angle of lower jaw.
 Raising of skin flaps: The skin incision is deepened to incise the subcutaneous tissue, platysma
and the investing layer of deep cervical fascia. The upper skin flap is reflected up towards
the lower border of the mandible, taking the deep cervical fascia along with the skin flap
to prevent injury to the marginal mandibular branch of facial nerve. The lower skin flap is
similarly raised to expose the superficial lobe of the submandibular gland. While raising
the skin flaps the superficial vein including the anterior facial vein needs to be ligated and
divided.
 Mobilization of superficial lobe of submandibular gland: The superficial lobe of the
submandibular gland is retracted superiorly and then lower pole of the gland is dissected
towards the posterior end. Towards the posterior end of the lower pole, the trunk of facial,
artery and vein are identified, dissected, ligated and divided. The superficial lobe of the gland
is mobilized by combination of sharp and blunt dissection. At the upper pole of the superficial
lobe of the gland, the facial artery and vein are again encountered, dissected ligated and
divided close to the gland.
 Mobilization of the deep part of the gland: As the superficial lobe of the gland is mobilized the
posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle is identified and the mylohyoid muscle is retracted
to expose the deep part of the gland which lies between the mylohyoid and the hyoglossus
muscle. Multiple small vessels lying between mylohyoid and hyoglossus muscle needs division
with electrocautery.
 Identification of lingual nerve: The deep part of the submandibular gland is retracted
downwards to identify the lingual nerve as a broad band of white tissue runing above the
submandibular duct.
 The lingual nerve runs forward over the hyoglossus intially above the submandibular duct
and then crosses the superficial aspect of the duct and winds round the lower border of the duct
to cross its medial aspect from below upwards.
 Dissection and division of submandibular duct: The submandibular duct emerges from the
anterior end of the deep part of the gland and runs on the hyoglossus muscle in close relation
to the lingual nerve. The submandibular duct is dissected up to, the floor of the mouth taking
care not to injure the lingual nerve and the hypoglossal nerve. The submandibular duct is
ligated with 2-0 polyglactin suture and divided close to the floor of the mouth. The lingual
nerve runs first above the submandibular duct then winds round it from lateral to medial side.
 Removal of deep part of the gland: The deep part of the gland is mobilized and dissected off
from the hyoglossus muscle taking care not to injure the hypoglossal nerve which lies deep to
the deep part of the gland on the hyoglossus.
1014 Section 9 Operative Surgery
 Closure: Hemostasis secured. A suction drain is placed at the submandibular fossa. The
subcutaneous tissue with the platysma is apposed with runing 3-0 polyglactin suture. Skin
apposed with 3-0 polyglactin subcuticular suture or with interrupted suture using 3-0
monofilament polyamide suture.





procedure 28:Describe the steps of type I modified radical neck dissection.
(There are three types of modified radical neck dissection:
 Type I: Radical Neck dissection with preservation of spinal accessory nerve.
 Type II: Radical neck dissection with preservation of spinal accessory nerve and the internal
jugular vein.
 Type III: Radical neck dissection with preservation of all three structures—spinal accessory
nerve (SAN), internal jugular vein (IJV) and the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM).
 Anaesthesia: General anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Position of the patient: Patient supine, arms on the sides of the body. Head turned to the
opposite side resting on a head ring and the head end elevated by about 15 degrees to reduce
the venous congestion.
Antiseptic dressing and draping: The antiseptic cleaning with povidone iodine from chin to the
midchest. Three towel draping for the head and draping of the remaining area by placement
of sterile sheets to expose the site of the operation.
 Incision: For unilateral dissection a Y shaped incision is made. The horizontal limb of the Y
starts from the point below the chin and taken downwards towards the hyoid bone and then
curves upwards towards the mastoid process. The vertical limb of the incision starts from the
middle of the horizontal limb and and then continue downwards in an S shaped manner
and ends just above the clavicle. The skin incision is deepened to incise subcutaneous fat and
the platysma.
 Raising of skin flaps: The posterior skin flap is raised first. The skin flap with subcutaneous
tissue and platysna is lifted up by two skin hooks and the the skin flap is lifted up by sharp
dissection from the underlying soft tissue till the anterior border of trapezius. While lifting
the posterior skin flap the spinal accessory nerve entering the anterior border of trapezius
should be preserved.
 While raising the upper skin flap two branches of facial nerve cervical branch and the
marginal mandibular branch has to be preserved. To do so, the deep fascia is incised at the
level of hyoid bone and extending up to the fascia covering the submandibular salivary gland.
The upper skin flap along with the deep fascia attached to the upper flap is lifted up by sharp
dissection up to the lower border of mandible taking care not to injure the branches of facial
nerve.
 The medial or anterior skin flap is lifted up by skin hooks and lifted in a subplatysmal plane
by sharp dissection just beyond the midline medially and below up to the clavicle exposing the
supraclavicular fossa.
 Early division of SCM and IJV: The lower end of the SCM at its origin from the sternum and
clavicle is dissected and divided by diathermy knife. The SCM is lifted up to expose the carotid
sheath.
 The fascia covering the carotid sheath is incised and the lower end of the internal jugular vein is
dissected by using a right angled forceps and 3 silk ligatures are passed around the IJV and IJV is
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 1015
ligated and divided keeping two ligatures distally. The lower cut end of the IJV may be transfixed
with 3-0 mersilk. While dissecting the IJV the vagus nerve should be taken care of.
 Supraclavicular dissection: The posterior triangle of the neck is divided by the inferior belly
of omohyoid into the upper occipital and lower supraclavicular triangle. The fascia over the
fat pad lateral to internal jugular vein is incised and the fat pad with the lymph nodes are
dissected up. While doing so the phrenic nerve running over the scalenus anterior muscle is
preserved. All the fat pad along with supraclavicular lymph nodes are dissected off from the
supraclavicular triangle taking care not to breach the prevertebral fascial layer covering the
brachial plexus. While dissecting the supraclavicular triangle the external jugular vein needs
to be dissected ligated and divided. The transverse cervical vessels also needs ligature and
division. The inferior belly of omohyoid is dissected close to its origin from the upper border of
scapula and divided by diathermy.
 Dissection of Chaissaignac’s triangle: This is the area between the medial border of scalenus
anterior muscle, IJV and the common carotid artery. The loose areolar tissue and the lymph
nodes are cleared from this area by sharp and blunt dissection. Important structures like
thyrocervical trunk, vertebral vein and thoracic duct on the left side and jugular lymphatic
trunk on the right side lies in this area. These strucutres are to be preserved carefully.
 Dissection of occipital triangle: Before starting dissection of occipital triangle the spinal
accessory nerve (SAN) needs to be dissected and safeguarded. The SAN is identified at the
posterior border of SCM at the junction of upper 1/3rd and lower 2/3rd. This is about 1cm above
the Erb’s point where the great auricular nerve turns around the posterior border of SCM. Once
the nerve is identified the SAN nerve is dissected along the posterior triangle up to the anterior
border of trapezius at its lower third. The nerve may also be identified using a nerve stimulator.
Once the SAN is safeguarded, the dissection proceeds along the anterior border of trapezius up
to the mastoid process and all loose areolar tissue and the lymph nodes in the occipital triangle
are cleared of the ascending branch of transverse cervical artery runing along the anterior
border of trapezius needs ligature and division.
 Division of upper end of SCM: Taking care of the SAN, the SCM is lifted up up to its insertion
into the mastoid process. The upper end of SCM is dissected free and divided close to its insertion.
The internal jugular vein is exposed.
 Division of upper end of IJV and carotid dissection: As the SCM and IJV are lifted up, the level
III and level IV lymph nodes are cleared off along with the IJV. The upper end of IJV is dissected
and 3 silk ligatures are passed around and ligated. The upper end of the IJV is now divided
keeping 2 ligatures towards the proximal side. Near the termination of internal jugular vein
the posterior belly of digastric muscle may be lifted up to clear the level II lymph nodes. While
dissecting the level II, III and IV nodes, the vagus nerve and common carotid artery is to be
taken care of.
 Dissection of level I lymph nodes: The fat in the submental area is incised and cleared. The
anterior belly of the digastric muscle is exposed. The superficial lobe of the submandibular
gland is exposed. The upper border of the of the submandibular gland is freed by dissecting
and dividing the facial vein and artery in between ligature at the lower border of the mandible.
The lower border of the superficial lobe is similarly freed by dissecting ,ligating and dividing
the facial artery and the vein at lower pole of the gland. The myelohyoid muscle is retracted in
a forward direction to identify the deep part of the submandibular gland. The lingual nerve
is identified as a broad band along the upper pole and the branches from the lingual nerve
to the submandibular ganglion is ligated and divided. The lingual nerve crosses around the
1016 Section 9 Operative Surgery
submandibular duct. The submandibular duct is dissected up to the floor of the mouth, ligated
and divided. The hypoglossal nerve runing in between the deep part of the submandibular
gland and the hyoglossus muscle is also preserved. All the loose areolar tissue and the lymph
nodes from submental triangle and submandibular triangle are cleared off by sharp and blunt
dissection. The small vessels that come on the way is controlled by electrocoagulation. The lower
pole of parotid gland is excised and overrun with 3-0 vicryl sutures.
 Check for hemostasis: Hemostasis is checked and any bleeding is controlled by electrocautery.
The wound is irrigated with normal saline.
 Placement of drain: Two 12 Fr tube drain is placed through the posterior flap and connected
to a vacuum drainage bag.
Closure: The subcutaneous tissue and the platysma is apposed by 3-0 polyglactin sutures. Skin
is approximated by interrupted 3-0 monofilament polyamide suture. Alternatively skin may
be apposed by subcuticular suture or skin staplers.

cricoid cartilage and the suprasternal notch. in emergency a vertical incision from the lower
border of the thyroid cartilage to the suprasternal notch may be used.
 Procedure:
•	 The skin, subcutaneous tissue and the platysma is incised in the same line. The investing
layer of the deep cervical fascia is incised in the midline and the strap muscles are retracted
on either side.
•	 The thyroid isthmus is exposed. This isthmus is divided in the midline in between forceps
and the trachea is exposed. The trachea is held fixed by a single hook retractor. A 1–2 cm
vertical incision is made on the trachea centering 3rd or 4th tracheal ring using a no. 11
knife. A tracheal dilator is inserted into the trachea with the blades in closed position. The
blades are opened and a cuffed tracheostomy tube is inserted into the trachea through
the tracheotomy. The tracheostomy tube is fixed by a strap tied around the neck. The
bleeding from the cut ends of the thyroid isthmus is controlled. The skin is closed with
interrupted silk stitches.
What are the complications of tracheostomy?
 Bleeding from the thyroid isthmus or brachiocephalic vein and inferior thyroid veins
 Blockage of tracheostomy tube—may result even in death.
 tracheal stenosis.



procedure 30:indications
 For feeding in patients with esophageal obstruction: corrosive stricture or carcinoma of
esophagus.
 For gastric decompression in a postoperative patient when passage of a nasogastric tube is
not feasible
 in cases of duodenal fistula: two tubes may be inserted through the gastrostomy. one kept in
the duodenum proximal to the site of leakage for aspiration and another tube passed beyond
the duodenum 25–30 cm beyond the fistula for feeding.
Describe the steps of gastrostomy.
 Anesthesia: General anesthesia or local anesthesia. For local anesthesia inject 20 mL
0.5% of injection lignocaine in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. After incising the skin
and subcutaneous tissue, another 20 mL is injected along the linea alba and the parietal
peritoneum.
 Incision: About 5 cm midline vertical incision starting from just below the xiphoid.
 Procedure:
•	 Skin and subcutaneous tissues are incised along the line of incision (Fig. 22.13A)
•	 The linea alba is incised in the midline
•	 The peritoneum is lifted in between the hemostatic forceps and a nick is made in the
parietal peritoneum and the incision in the peritoneum is extended
•	 The wound margin is retracted and the stomach is identified (Figs 22.13B and c)
•	 The skin below the left costal margin is infiltrated with injection lignocaine and an incision
is made lateral to the outer border of rectus abdominis (Fig. 22.13D).
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 1019
•	 The gastrostomy tube (22 Fr. Foley’s or Malaecot’s catheter) is brought into the abdomen
through this stab wound (Fig. 22.13e).
•	 The stomach is held by two pairs of Babcock’s tissue forceps. A stab wound is made in the
anterior wall of the stomach high up in the body between the greater and lesser curvature
of the stomach (Fig. 22.13F). The gastrostomy tube is introduced through the stab wound
with the tip directed toward the pylorus
•	 A purse string suture is applied around the stab wound and is tightened around the tube.
insert two more purse string suture around each 0.5 cm apart inverting the previous layers
(Fig. 22.13G)
•	 The stomach wall is fixed to the parietal peritoneum by 2 or 3 interrupted chromic catgut
sutures (Fig. 22.13H)
•	 The incision is closed in layers. The gastrostomy tube is fixed to the skin. 

What is Witzel gastrostomy?
in Witzel gastrostomy instead of series of purse string suture, the gastrostomy tube is buried in
the stomach wall by creating a tunnel in the stomach wall. The wall of the stomach on either
side of the gastrostomy tube is sutured to create the tunnel.
What is Deepage Janeway gastrostomy?
This is a technique of permanent gastrostomy. A flap is raised from the anterior wall of the
stomach and is formed into a tube. The stomach tube is brought out and sutured to the skin to
create a permanent gastrostomy.
What are the other techniques of gastrostomy?
 Laparoscopic gastrostomy
 Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
Why it is not desirable to do a gastrostomy in a patient with inoperable carcinoma of
esophagus?
in inoperable carcinoma of esophagus patient has problems of swallowing of food and saliva.
Gastrostomy allows feeding but does not provide any relief for the distressing problems of
swallowing of the saliva. So it is not desirable to do gastrostomy. Some form of esophageal
stenting is preferable.


procedure 31:What are the steps of eversion of sac (Fig. 22.14)?
 Antiseptic dressing and draping.
 Anesthesia: operation is done under local
anesthesia. The spermatic cord is infiltrated
with 2% lignocaine hydrochloride. The scrotal
skin along the line of incision is also infiltrated
with lignocaine hydrochloride.
 Skin incision: A vertical incision is made
parallel to the median raphe of the scrotum.
 Incising the layers of scrotum: The incision
is deepened to cut the dartos muscle the
scrotal fascia and the hydrocele sac lined by
the parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis is
exposed.
 Incising the parietal layer of tunica vaginalis:
The tunica vaginalis sac is separated from the
dartos muscle layer by finger dissection and
a space created between the tunica vaginalis
and the dartos.
An incision is made over the tunica vaginalis in an avascular area anteriorly away from the
testis, epididymis and cord structures and fluid drained.
The tunica vaginalis incision is then extended and testis delivered out of the tunica vaginalis
sac.
figure 22.14: Eversion of sac
chapter 22 Operative Surgery 1021
 Eversion of sac: The cut margin of the tunica vaginalis sac is everted around the testis.
 Suturing the cut margins of tunica vaginalis: The cut margin is stitched behined the testis
with 1-0 chromic catgut sutures.
 Hemostasis is secured and the testis with the everted sac placed back into the scrotal sac.
 Closure: The dartos muscle is stitched with 1-0 continuous chromic catgut sutures.
The skin is sutured with interrupted monofilament polyamide suture. A coconut bandage
is then applied.




procedure 32:indications
1. Religious: Muslims and Jews
2. Phimosis
3. Paraphimosis.
Describe the steps of circumcision (Figs 12.15A to F).
 in adults this is usually done under local anesthesia and in children usually done under
general anesthesia
 The penis is cleaned with an antiseptic solution (povidone iodine) and draped with a sterile
sheet

 infiltration anesthesia using 1% lignocaine injection (without adrenaline). The local anesthetic
is injected all around the base of the penis. Wait for 5 minutes.
 The tip of the prepuce is grasped with two pairs of mosquito forceps and the adhesion between
the prepuce and the glans penis is separated (Fig. 22.15A).
 A dorsal cut is made in the prepuce with scissors extending proximally up to 5 mm of the
corona glandis (Fig. 22.15B). The cut is then taken around the penis to the ventral aspect
toward the frenulum and the preputial skin is excised (Figs 22.15B and c).
 once the prepuce is excised there are bleeding from a number of points. The skin is retracted
over the penis and the bleeding points are held up by mosquito forceps and ligated with 3-0
catgut sutures.
 The skin edges are then sutured with 3-0 chromic catgut sutures. The dorsal and ventral
midline sutures are applied first and the remaining cut edges of the prepuce is sutured with
interrupted 3-0 chromic catgut sutures (Fig. 22.15e). A figure of 8 stitch in ventral mid line
controls the frenular artery (Fig. 22.15F).
 A light dressing is applied.
